                    "Out of 4 recent business class flights between Europe and Australia I had problems with two, which made the journeys very uncomfortable and troublesome, and created other problems. They inappropriately dealt with both of them, according to me, on top of telling me things that turned out to be wrong, further showing unreliability of their claims.\nIn one case, my expensive “business-class” seat had no electric power at all, for a 12-hour flight (out of a 24-hour total flying trip with them) ; This, even though they knew it before the flight. So, no electric command was working: The electronic commands of the seat, so that I could not move the seat nor adjust its position or shape ; The headlights were also not working (so no real light when cabin lights were off) nor was the call button, so I could not even call the staff for any kind of assistance, but had to go and see them to ask for anything. This for 12-hours …\nFor this they offered a voucher of 200 Singapore$ (147 US$, 136 €) limited to purchase in their gift shop … Singapore Airline staff in two different locations, told me things that turned out to be false, resulting also in waste of time: That their customer service would contact me for this ; they didn’t. Then (the sales people, basically the only ones that I managed to call) that if I wrote, via their website (essentially the only real way to contact the customer service, since other claimed options didn’t work in practice and so were just a source of further waste of time), Singapore would answer “within 72 hours, maximum” ; They did after 1 month ... (perhaps thanks to a reminder I sent 12 days later). And this didn’t turn out to be very constructive either. \nThis case shows how little they value customer’s comfort in business class (in spite of advertising the opposite) and customers' time. So does the 2nd case: we missed the connection between 2 SA flights, in Singapore, due to late 1st flight, but no assistance from SA, eg to reorganize our arrival, (resulting in waste of time and money). Except for having automatically rebooked us on a future flight, even though we could have just made it for the initially planned connecting flight, particularly since flying business class: we could have arrived at the departing plane 8 minutes before its closing door time ; I told the ground staff but they refused.\nI asked whether European law (or similar Singapore law) would apply ; After 1.5 months they told me they are still reviewing the question ...   ",
                    "During check-in at Sydney Airport, I requested the agent to seat my wife beside my 6 year old grand daughter and me to be seated in her seat 17K.\nOur original seat whilie booking were 16A, 16C and 16D. SQ reseated us to 17 D and K wothout any valid reason, and left my grand daughter alone with a unknown gentleman. I argued like hell that SQ had split the family in 3 different seats and left my grand daughter in unsafe condition. Finally SQ seated only me beside the grand daughter.\nOur family tradition is that the mother, aunt or grand mother will take the girl to rest rooms and take care of any assistance.\nThat is the reason I requested for my wife to sit beside the young girl.\n\nThe agent was very sympathetic but she lacked authority to reseat us.\nShe called her supervisor  a Catherine. Immediately she arrived at the counter, she questioned me in loud and arrogant voice as to why a change was needed. I explained to her that full details were given to the agent. She ignored that and again in the same demeaning voice asked me to explaint. I tried  to but she became very angry and said she would call authorities and then she made a loud remark that she will not speak to me anymore. She asked if any other person can answer her questions about my booking. Monica Singh answered the rest of her questiones and the seats were then changed. She never asked her agent to explain as to why she was called there.\n\nWhile this was happening, the original agent Linda was shame faced and could not look into our faces.\n\nShe apologised about 5 times about her supervisors behaviour.\n\nI asked to speak to the SQ Sydney  Manager of the day. The agent Linda informed me that he will come and see me in the lounge.\n\nWe waited for a few hours but no sign of the manager.\n\nDuring the flight I related the story to a senior attendent and she could not believe her ears. The matter reported to the Cabin Head and it was logged in the log.\n\nI put a comlaint feedback to SQ Kris flyer and advised that I should never face that type of person again and Our next trip was to Japan with SQ in March 2023.\nOn this trip our family had spent more that $33,000 to travel Business class for my Grand daughters birthday. That supervisor should never be near business class people.\n\nBut the cabin crew after learning the reason for the trip made my grand daughter feel like a celebrity. They arranged for birthday card, cake, gift and full birthday song in flight.\n\nThe Captain of the flight made her feel very good later on the groung and had 2 photos taken with her.\n \nTill today SQ Management have not come back to me at all. No apology or what action they have taken.\n\nWhat makes it worse is that supervisor asked us to swap seat on Board. She should have known the regulations:\n\nI.In event of turbulence we have to return to our original seats. This would have happened many times during that flt.\n\n2. In event of an accident the ID of the person is done by PNL first. Ours would have been mixed.\n\n3. By refusing to talk and confirming the  passengers answers the agent had broken the carrier, the IATA and Australian CASA and Singapore CAAS rules. So it becomes a reportable incident.\n4. SQ says they care but it seems like it is a good slogan but lack any good action. They have remained silent so far. I asked for a feed back again but nothing. Another story next entry.\n5. We the whole family fly SQ everywhere even if the trip is longer. The cabin crew make our trip very very good and that is the main reason we fly SQ.\n\nI will give a similar but worse story about SQ Management in future write up.",

                    "I'm so angry, Singapore Airlines used to be good, but when booking a ticket to Vietnam, they sneakily put you on Scoot - for an 8 hour flight! I paid for a full price, full service ticket - they clearly must have put operated by Scoot in very small writing somewhere, to say I'm upset is an understatement. I could have booked a Scoot ticket for $200, not the $800 I paid to not have to sit for 8 hours on a horrible plane. My whole trip is ruined, I've been having a really hard time and now I'm stuck on what is going to be a miserable flight. To cancel costs half the ticket price. The same has happened for my return leg! Shame on you Singapore Airlines, this is the last time I will ever book with such an unethical and untrustworthy company! Thank you for ruining my first holiday in years!",
                    "We have previously flown with SA and been impressed by the quality of both service and overall operations.Unfortunately since the Pandemic things seem to have gone wrong.\nWe flew to Cairns in Au last April 2022  but even before we left our flight times and dates were changed  twice leaving us having to make last minute changes to accommodation  and car rental at extra cost.Then they lost my suitcase for 12 days and I spent everyday trying to reach reps in various parts of Australia who seemed to only operate on mobile phones.Eventually after I had tracked the case to The Whitsunday Islands and spent several days talking to Greg,one of only three members of staff at the tiny airport it suddenly appeared on the drive of my daughters house with no notice or explanation! I was paid the grand sum of $12.45 per day as compensation after complaining.\nUnfortunately we had already booked two more retur  flights with SA and have just returned from our latestwhich was to spend Xmas with family in AU.\nThis too was changed several times with the initial change giving us a return date of Christmas Day! I have every sympathy  with the poor young people in the contact centre who seem to have to continually cope with frustrated customers but seem to have little control over the ever changing schedule.We eventually found ourselves moved to a return flight on New Year's Eve which of course wrecked any New Year plans.\nThis week I received two more emails from SA which changed both our outbound and return flights booked for this April,the latter change leaving us with an unwanted two day layover in Singapore where we were expected to arrange and pay for our own hotelAfter further extended calls to the contact centre we have been offered another date.However .\nthis  rearrangement offered means no extended layover but a return  date of the 5th June when our original booking was for the 22nd May!\nWhat is going  on.Is the published schedule simply a work of fiction.\nAll the original \nflights were paid for and confirmed and booked direct with SA. But all have been changed to less convenient and wildly different dates with no explanation or compensation.",

                    "I am yet to fly with Singapore Airlines as my tickets are booked for October but I can honestly say this is the worst booking experience we have ever had. We booked through an authorised agent and the booking including an infant in seat. \n\nWe checked all the requirements on Singapore Airlines website and purchased a car sear which fit all their criteria. This was particularly expensive  as the seat needed to be CAA certified. We were then notified by SA that we couldn't have the infant with seat even though we had paid for it and even though we had followed their own guidelines. They advised that the infant had to be over 6 months which it doesn't state on any of their literature. \n\nSA took weeks looking into this issue during which time my tickets were voided incorrectly causing issues with my credit card. I called 11 times to the helpline when managers promised to call back but failed to do so. \n\nThe whole process has been a nightmare and other than offering hollow apologies Singapore Airlines have been incredibly unhelpful. I would never book with them again and would warn anyone else used to Emirates or Etihad to steer clear.",
                    "I originally took advantage of a good fare for Premium Economy on this route.  I paid additional to choose one of the single seats towards the back of the plane.   After booking I reviewed my choice on Set Guru I decided to choose a different seat.  Logged onto the website and when I tried to change, it wanted to charge me again for the premium single seat so I didn't complete the transaction.  But then according to the website, I had no seat assignemn\n\nFlat out, Singapore's online and phone customer service just sucks!  Their website seems to have been developed by a neaderthal.  \n\nSo then I was offered an opportunity to upgrade to Business Class for a reasonable increment, which I accepted.  When I tried to choose a seat online or through the smartphone",
                    "We booked to fly Singapore Airlines on both legs to discover we had been changed to Lufthansa on the longer 13 hour leg without our concent.

We deliberately took a 4 hour longer flight to avoid Lufthansa only to have Singapore Airlines do this to us.\nWe are not happy.",
                    "We have booked to fly from Sydney to London in August, the first trip we will take with our new born, who is due in May. We wanted to secure seats for our preferred dates now, which has led to multiple problems. You cannot book a flight online without name, date of birth and passport information, an issue when the infant has not been born yet. \nBefore booking our flight we scoured their website for answers to this catch 22 to no avail. We then called Singapore and after hours on hold were told that we had to book the flight for my partner and myself first, and then call back and add the baby on, at which time they would assign us to preferred seats with a bassinet.\nWe booked our flights and called back, and completely contrary to the information we had been given before, we were told that they are unable to book a baby onto the flight without these details and that there is no option but to wait until we have a passport for the unborn baby to book the flight. We asked whether we could book the seats that were suitable for a parent and child without adding on the bassinet seat and we were told that we could only reserve these seats for an exorbitant fee (this is a free service when you pay for a child's ticket). \n\nWe currently still have no resolution - their customer service is only able to read from a script and cannot escalate the problem to someone with decision making ability. We were already concerned about making such a trip with a new born, but due to circumstance we are unable to delay, and Singapore have done nothing to make the experience any better. I warn any expectant parents not to travel with Singapore, they are not prepared to offer any flexibility to accommodate passengers.",
                    "Ground crew asked us to check in our carry on as mine was 2 kg over the 7kg limit for international flights. While waiting to be boarded, we confirmed with many passengers whose carry ons appeared large in size and weight. None were asked to weigh or check in their luggage. We were on the airbus that was half empty and overhead bins could easily accommodate our carry ons (as it did all other HUGE carry ons).  At the very least, operation is certainly inconsistent. \nOn a 16 plus hour flight, we were served dinner and breakfast with nothing in between! We had to go fetch for water twice ourselves while the flight crew gathered in the back chatting. Service is slow. The seat is average. Food is mediocre.  Male attendant was rude and condescending when asked about food options. Toilet cabinet is small even for my 102 lb size.  On the plus side, leg room is better than average. \nWould definitely not consider this airline for future travels.",

We called customer care, and they assured us the booking went through and we won't be charged. But at airport they denied any booking and again charged us for the bag and told us to sort out the issue with customer care. We called the customer care multiple times and everytime we have to describe the. exact same thing and they ask for receipt and documents. We upload and they assured us we will be refunded. I AM NEVER FLYING WITH SINGAPORE AIRLINNES AGAIN, BAD SERVICE IS ONE THING, BUT THEY ARE SCAMMING PEOPLE FOR EXTRA MONEY.",

I flew by myself with my 3 small children and I was looked after SO incredibly well. The staff were very sincere and would always stop to ask if they could mind the kids so that I could have a bathroom break. They would offer to bring me warm water for my toddler's bottle. They would hold my 10-month-old baby so that I could change my toddler's nappy in the bathroom. They had lovely children's meals and toys to keep them entertained. They went out of their way to make sure that I'm happy and not overwhelmed. As always, the aircraft itself was in immaculate condition, the bathrooms perfectly clean every time, I had ample room for my legs and the entertainment system worked perfectly. I had a transit from Singapore, the flight attendant from the first flight (Melbourne to Singapore) told her flight attendant friend (who would be on my second flight) to \"please look after the kind lady, traveling by herself with 3 children\", which she did. I've just booked my flight back to Melbourne with Singapore Airlines from Johannesburg on the 29th of January and I can't wait, it will be my 3rd time flying with Singapore Airlines. They are 100% the best and most reliable airline that there is.

Also left two of our cases behind on return.  No help or consideration..Left our house key in one case.(I know, very stupid) cost £245 for emergency locksmith...No sympathy from Singapore Airlines..if cases were lost. Then I could have claimed, but they had our cases and refuse to take any responsibility. Lots of other little things went wrong. Ruined a trip of a lifetime....I can honestly say, I can rough it with the best, and except that things can go wrong. But they could have been a lot more understanding with the situations....No more Singapore Airlines for me...",
                    "I have used SQ and Changi often and generally praised both. Unfortunately both have declined significantly in the last few years - be wary!\n\nThe SQ631 HND-SIN experience 4 October 2023 is the worst airline experience of my couple of decades of international flying.\n\nAll was going to schedule on the day and all passengers boarded and the plane commenced taxiing. Part way through taxiing, the plane pulled over into a parking bay and passengers were left sitting for 1.5hrs with no announcement! I asked a crew member if they knew anything about what was going on and was just given a stupid answer of \"normal delay\"! So if flying SQ it is now 'normal' to pull into a parking bay and watch engineers on ladders inspecting something in the engine bay!\n\nFinally after 1.5hrs of sitting a brief announcement \"technical issue\" still trying to be resolved. It was around another 1.5hr of sitting before the next announcement stating we'd have to wait around 20min for busses to come and take us back to the terminal.\n\nPassengers understand that things can go wrong but to just leave us sitting for 1.5hr with no announcement whatsoever is ridiculous ...and then another 1.5hr!\n\nFinally we're all bussed back to the terminal and left sitting for an hour or so before some incomprehensible announcement in English is made apparently to queue up for meal vouchers for lunch. What should be a 5sec process per passenger to hand out meal vouchers (show boarding pass, have it endorsed and be handed vouchers) was an excruciatingly long process with the huge queue moving about 50cm a minute.\n\nAnd then staff ran out of vouchers!!! More waiting for staff to find some more. Finally get vouchers which could only be claimed at a cheap food court upstairs which was already crowded with no spare tables.\n\nA number of staff at the gate were standing around dumbfounded and others looking busy walking around with tablets asking questions but not achieving anything.\n\nNo offer of overnight accommodation and flights the next day, one had virtually no choice but await an email with what alternative flights SQ decided to hand out. So what should have been a pleasant day flight to SIN turned into an overnight nightmare arriving SIN 2:20am and having to wait 4.5hr for flight to KUL with no offer of accommodation or lounge!!! I had to ask for accommodation/lounge at Changi and only then given a pass for the Krisflyer Gold Lounge - thankfully better than nothing but not the standard expected of supposedly one of the world's top full service airlines.\n\nFlight SIN-KUL 7:00am 5 October had no entertainment facilities and not a single scrap of food was offered - not even a packet of peanuts!\n\nOverall SQ's performance experienced is now that of an expensive budget airline - not worth the premium anymore - avoid!\n\nAs for Changi, I went to meet my girlfriend at the gate earlier in the trip and observed the plane arriving at the gate but passengers and gate staff all had to wait half an hour for somebody to operate the airbridge! Seems Changi and SQ management are following suit.\n",
                    "I am writing this review of serious complaint.   \n\nPrior to my flight leaving the UK I had all the documents I needed which included the following:\nNegative PCR test \nAustralian Declaration \nPassport \nMy Australian Visa which I have held for almost 4 years. \nDouble Vaccination certificate (which I got in Australia) \nI live and work in Australia and have done for the past 5 years. I was visiting my family after 3 years as the international boarders have just recently opened to Skilled work visas. \n\nI arrived at Heathrow airport 4 hours before my scheduled flight and waited in the queue prior to check in. It was very busy and a staff member was making sure all passengers had the correct information. I got all the boxes ticked and queued to send my suitcase and do final check in. The lady at the desk took all my information and I placed my bag up ready for check in. She then asked if I had an \"Australian Exemption\". I explained I didn't need an exemption as I hold a visa for Australia and meet all the requirements meaning I do not need to apply for one. The lady then made a call for help as I don't think she knew what she doing. Another staff member came over to help and they both told me that I couldn't board this flight because I needed an Australian Exemption. I then began to feel extremely overwhelmed/stressed and anxious as I was due back to work on the Monday 7th and really needed to catch this flight. They took my bag off the check in and turned me away. The man who came over to help said he can re-book my flight for the same time 24 hours later (on Sunday 6th February) and told me that I could either pay for an express exemption otherwise the exemption could take up to 5 days to come through. Although they did not believe me when I told them I didn't need one. \n\nI got driven home which took almost an hour and opened up my laptop to start applying for an exemption as directed by the staff at Singapore Airlines. Once I filled in all my details and applied for the exemption it came back saying that based on the information I had provided 'I DID NOT NEED AN EXEMPTION' this was also information that is clearly stated on the Australian Government home affairs website. This is exactly what I had originally told the Singapore Airlines staff who wouldn't let me board the plane. Please see attached photo of my outcome. \n\nSo not only did the staff working for Singapore airlines give false and misleading information but they turned me away and made me miss my flight which I seriously needed to get - this gave me incredible anxiety.\n\nI instantly called Singapore Airlines to rebook my flight for the next available one.  The staff member on customer services said that he could re book my flight for this time.\n\nI was waiting roughly an hour for the changes to be confirmed via email, but I didn't receive anything. I was extremely frustrated and panicking so then called Singapore airlines AGAIN to ask why my changes had not come through? I got through to a staff member called \"Tim\" he wouldn't give me his surname. He said that no changes had been made and I couldn't make the changes as I booked through a third party. He also told me that the flight was FULL which was another complete lie as I managed to eventually board this flight and many rows where empty. The first call I made he said he had made the changes and had sent a confirmation email and then when I called back to follow it up 'Tim' is saying no changes were made? I was been constantly given wrong information by Singapore Airlines and this wasted hours of my time and caused even more stress! I wasn't getting anywhere with customer services over the phone they said they could not help me at all and was extremely unhelpful. They told me it was all to do with the third party. Which it had nothing to do with them. I had wasted too much time so drove back to the airport and speak with Singapore Airlines face to face.\n\nI arrived back at the airport at roughly 1:30pm and spoke with the help desk. I explained my situation to her and she made a call. I received no apology on behalf of Singapore airlines. She then told me that I would find out if I can board the flight when I get to check in and she re booked my flight. The airline should know all this information and it's disgusting they don't.  So again, Singapore customer services over the phone lied as they said they couldn't make changes to my now missed flight but as soon as I got to the airport and spoke with someone face to face, they managed to put me on another flight. I then waited another 2.5 hours anxious and stressed as I didn't know if they would let me board the plane again even though I had all my documents. \n\nWhen arriving at the check in the lady behind the counter was shocked and apologized (first apology I received) she said she doesn't understand why I couldn't board the first flight as I had all the correct documents, I would have needed to board the original flight.\n\nI am Vegan and requested vegan special meals prior to my original flight. They told me I couldn't get vegan meals on this new flight as they needed to be pre ordered like I had on my original flight. This meant I went all the way to Brisbane with no food. 24 hours. They did offer me a bread roll and nuts but this is not substantial. Having been a vegan for the entirety of my adult life I am acutely aware of the mixed connotations surrounding veganism and its attachment to some of the more life-threatening dietary issues.  I would however like to express that I find it wholeheartedly unacceptable that this was not taken more seriously. The result of which, thankfully, only lead to my sustained hunger for over 24 hours, something given the plight of many I can not complain of too much. However the principle of a dietary requirement of an individual not being of the utmost importance to an airline, given the severity of which some may jeopardise the Health & Safety of everyone involved, scares me a little. \n\nI had asked the lady at the desk if there is any upgrade I could have for the flight as I needed to sleep as I was now having to go straight to work as soon as I landed this new flight but she said she didn't have any authorization to do so but to speak to a REP. Once I had checked in my bag and received my boarding pass, I waited for a rep. \n\nI spoke to a REP lady who again apologized sincerely for the mistake but again told me there was nothing she could do regarding an upgrade for the flight. But gave me this email address to write my complaint.\n\nMy mum had taken me to the airport twice and this cost over 50 pounds in car parking fees.\n\nSince February I have been back and forth with a customer service representative. Had no car park fees paid back and was offered a gift card worth $200 which I declined as wanted flight credit. I still have no received anything and so much more deserving. \n\nFinally, I would like to end with the emotioanl distress this incident caused both myself, my family in the UK & my family in Australia. As touched on previously this was my first trip back to the UK in over 3 years (*confirm), at a time when the World is in the midst of a pandemic. A time when my own stress levels are exasperated by the need to feel safe. To then be told by several of your colleagues that I wasn't able to return to my home & family in Australia, without any one individual providing me adequate proof to refute my claim of exemption, really shook me emotionally & physically. The underlying feeling of anxiety I endured both at the time of the incident, during my rescheduled flight & following on from this has led to an upsetting change in my emotional state of mind, something I hadn't experienced prior.  \n\nAll in all, I feel incredibly let down by Singapore Airlines as it failed to deliver, in my eyes, on many key areas an Airline should. \n\nI have STILL not received any email its been 7 MONTHS! It is absolutely disgusting and disgraceful.",
                    "This must be one of the worst Airlines out there. I would recommend any potential passengers to reconsider and consider alternative airlines",

                    "My sister and our partners booked our flights for our family holiday 10 months before our trip so we could be on the same flights and get the window seats we always prefer. I booked business and my sister booked premium economy and our flights went via Singpaore with a one hour layover. A few months later Singapore took premuim economy off our flight and moved my sister and partner to a flight that them meant they had a 4 hour layover in Singapore and we had to purchase separate airport transfers. A short time after that they reinstated premium economy but DID NOT offer my sister and her partner their original flights/saets back. We have tried continuously to get them back on their original flights and Singapore have not helped at all. We have emailed and called. Obviously they do not care and are happy for our family trip to now cost more for transfers and inflict an uneccessary 4 hour airport layover onto passengers with NOTHING offered to make this situation better. The bare minium would be lounge access for the four hour layover but no nothing. It is not fair that I will board my flight and see the seats my sister and her partner booked and should be seated in only for them to be filled by others who booked much later than them!! Not fair Singapore Airlines! We travel Internationally at least twice a year but all our family will avoid Singapore Airlines because they do not show any semblance of caring. It is all about the money.",

Would only use them now if no other option. Extremely disappointed. \n\nTrip excellent, staff great on all 4 planes. Excellent COVID management but let down by supposed support staff.

                    "We flew to London Via Sinapore and the plane to Brisbane was so uncomfortable, the seats hard and when reclined tilted forward making it hard to get comfortable.  The staff were good offering refreshments at times although seemed to take a long time to get to serving.  a special request meal was basically tomoato and pasta and no extra.\n \nThe flight between Singapore and Heathrow was better the staff were great. the meals were better.\n\nThe flight back to Singapore we upgraded at great cost to business class which was great.  The facilities are getting a little dated now but it was good and the meals etc were good.\nThe retrun to Brisbane was ok and seemed better than the way to Singapore.  We felt dissapointed we did not receive a breakfast or something before arriving as we arrived early in the morning Brisbane time and had not had anything to eat for a while.\n\nTo add to this, our luggage was damaged. we had it wrapped in Brisbane, but it looked like it had been crushed in something.  I submitted a claim and no response and despite many attempts at responding to the online response and also calling, I have had no response and anyone on the phone is not able to assist.\nI also noticed we did not receive out miles for the Business Class upgrade and again it is still ongoing.  I submitted a milage claim online and received it was rejected and now I have had to provide details to try and get it looked at.  Woudnt it be in the system?????  I used to think Singapore Airlines was a good airline but now do not think so unless you are willing to pay significantly more.",
                    "Flew business class to Bali and back.  First the good--the aircraft was new, clean, and roomy.  Compared to US airlines, the flight crew were divine.  Very attentive, very fast and accommodating to every need.  The food was very good and enough to have me feel full.  Champagne was a nice bottle of true Champagne.  Was able to lay down fully and get some sleep, which I normally cannot.  Now the challenging--trying to get someone to help you at this airline out of the air is almost impossible.  Then once you do get ahold of someone, they are relatively rude and unable to help.  The experience we had was that we wanted to change our flight coming back.  We could see on-line that there was available seats.  We were even willing to downgrade to economy from business class for part of the trip to accommodate.   They would not consider.  Instead, they said we had to upgrade our tickets to the highest level that was another $10k.  We commented that we could buy the ticket online for $5k.  The comment was \"yes you are correct.  It does cost you more to change than to buy a new ticket\"  Crazy.  We pushed a little harder and finally got a manager who said that they could not do anything over the phone and that we had to go to the airport to change.  We interrupted our trip to go to the ticket counter to try and change.   At the counter, with a local to help translate, was told that they could do noting and in fact, they were only the ticket counter and were not really part of the airline and that we had to go to the office INSIDE security.  Luckily, security allowed us and once there, got the same story.  Fortunately for this airline, the pilots and attendance make up for the complete incompetence of management and their customer service",

I was over the weight limit as I expected but I was ok with paying more as I didn't have much of a choice. Neither legs of the flight were busy. Not many people at all and most passangers had 3 seats to themselves. Despite this they charged me over 1100NZD  for the extra weight on my checked in luggage. While I understand there are set prices for extra weight, I think based on the lack of passengers, they shouldn't be charging so much and could have shown some decency.",

                    "Had the most horrific dealings with Singapore airlines check in manager at Changi airport, firstly my wife is registered as disabled and my wife and i are both in our 60's.\nWe booked extra legroom seats because of my wife's disability and returned from Singapore to London Heathrow on flight SQ306 on Monday 29th May 2023, we had a really upsetting and stressful experience after we boarded the flight, this was also witnessed by the cabin crew who have submitted a separate report by leading steward Benjamin Khoo.\nThe problem was caused by the boarding gate manager in Singapore, we boarded at gate 9.\nThe first issue was that the seats we had booked were 31A and 31C in premium economy were emergency exit seats and we were told that we would have to be moved because of my wife's mobility issues, this was fine and we were allocated seats 32H and 32K, we were taken to the gate (my wife in a wheelchair) and boarded with no issues and got settled into our seats for the long 13 hour flight home.\nObviously the people who were originally in the seats that we moved to were offered the free upgrade for the extra legroom seats we had originally booked, this is where the problems started.\nOne of the passengers ( a male in his late 20's early 30's  )who was moved was not happy with the free upgrade and there was obviously a lot of discussions taking place which we could witness from where we were seated but did not know the content of, eventually the check in manager entered the plane ( the same man who gave us our new seats ) and after a few minutes of talking to the man in his 20's / 30's came over to where we were now settled and said that the man was not happy with his new upgraded seat and wanted his original seat back, he ordered us to move to seats 33F and 33G which were middle aisle seats, i told the manager that my wife needed to get up and move around to stop her seizing up, but he was not interested and said move or he would have us escorted from the plane, he was extremely rude and arrogant and was not interested in my wife's disability and the pain it then caused her to move again, he was more interested in letting a fit and able young man have his original seat back. this exchange was witnessed by multiple passengers and crew, the lady who was moved with this young man was not happy either and would have been happy to stay in her upgraded extra legroom seat, if this is the quality of management that Singapore airlines wish to employ we will never travel with Singapore airlines  again, this man has single handily destroyed my faith in Singapore airlines.\nThe stewards on the plane were very sorry for what they had witnessed and truly did all they could to try to make up for what had happened but ultimately this check in manager represents the whole of Singapore airlines and this individual had no concern or care for my wife's disability, my wife was extremely upset and we both felt stressed and anxious by this extremely unpleasant experience and would like to think that some form of action be taken against the manager that caused this issue. \nI emailed Singapore airlines on our return and received a reply which blamed the crew on the plane, i replied telling them the facts again but received no reply, i have tried contacting Singapore airlines a few times and have given them plenty of time to reply but now is the time to tell the world just how Singapore airlines deal with disabled passengers.\nFinally, i was promised a refund for the upgraded seats we had paid for but have still not received anything, my next email will be to the AviationADR as Singapore airlines clearly do not care about disabled passengers",

They had to stay in the air port lounges for more than 24hours. They were not given Airport hotel room or food. Luckily my father had some dollars with him to buy food. Till to date Singapore airlines haven’t apologise or reimburse the expenses.  I thought Singapore airline is an airline that I could rely on. However, this airline does not care for their customers anymore. My parents had to spend the Christmas sitting in an airport lounge.",
                    "We purchased a round trip tickets. From Jakarta to Seoul was good no problem occured.  But, this bad exprience  was a night flight from Seoul to Jakarta. Food was nice but service was not quite good. My companion and I check-in early but we got seperate seat, they say so because of the system, alright I didn't argue much. Then, It was almost time to be on board but the staff still check every passangers (who were already queueing ) to make sure one passanger only carry one cabin luggage or a bag with max 7kg. They insist to weight every bag. If over 7 kg , they need to check in the bag. They said it because the flight was full booked. Well, they should have announced this during check-in time, duh! Not when we were ready to on board. And to add another annoyance there were two babies taking turns crying during this 7 or 8 hours night flight. Bravo! I would say Air Asia service was better than this",
                    "Note: This review includes SQ47 (Economy) and SQ422 (which was in Business)\n\nSQ used to be my home airline, and I used to really enjoy flying with them. I was looking forward to experiencing them after the pandemic, and I was left with mixed feelings, being disappointed after the first, and impressed after the second?\n\nMy first flight from Vancouver to Singapore, I was waitlisted for an upgrade. However, this caused a problem with my ticket, resulting in about a 30 minute check in process. Additionally, the check-in staff requested my OCI (an Indian overseas citizenship), despite my second flight being on a separate ticket made from a different mileage account, and the check-in staff only checking the bag through to Singapore, as they apparently couldn't see my onward booking. They tried to avoid this question, and while I suspect it was so they could charge us extra in Singapore, since the baggage allowance is different for flights from Singapore to India, I won't make any assumptions.\n\nMy initial reaction to the seat was that it definitely felt smaller than the older A350 seats (since I believe these are the same ones used on the 787 with a narrower cabin). I was seated in an extra legroom seat for this flight (48K), which I recommend if you're flying on the A350. It has a window, great legroom, and if you're relatively small, you can also get out into the aisle without disturbing your seatmates.\n\nI have to say, the entertainment system aboard SQ is great. Additionally, as KF members, we had access to unlimited free wifi throughout the flight, which worked great, and which was surprisingly fast. I ended up using it the whole flight. \n\nThe food on this flight was substandard. The first meal was fine, a bit on the small side, but I was OK with it. The second meal, however, was very low quality, and dry. Considering there were only 2 major meal services, I expected something more substantial, and with SQ being named \"Best Airline in the World\", I definitely expected more. Attached with this review is  a picture of a similar meal served on my Emirates flight a few weeks later. \n\nHowever, what really disappointed me was the service. One of the crew members working my section was very friendly and warm. However, I witnessed poor service from the other crew members. The other crew seemed to be a bit hostile. When I went to get snacks from the aft galley, the crew members were extremely unfriendly, and seemed quite annoyed when I asked what options were available. Also saw 2 crew on the other side of the cabin screaming at a passenger who went to use the washroom before takeoff (which is completely understandable lol, so I didn't think much of it), but throughout the flight, they seemed to be unfriendly, and later screamed at a passenger seated near me who asked a question about the special assistance they needed disembarking, which is unacceptable behavior. \n\nCrew are extremely important to any experience, and growing up, I remember the friendly service from crew, and the care they treated children with aboard flights, which really built a strong image of SQ for me. However, I never saw that for the children seated behind me from the majority of the cabin crew, and to me, this shows either a drop in standard, or a lack of training. I have experienced friendlier cabin crew aboard budget airlines like Swoop, which certainly doesn't charge the same as SQ. I've seen poor service on SQ (particularly on flights to the US, including in business class), but this was worse than what I've seen before, and I really hope this is not caused by lack of crew rest, as I noticed the crew working most of the flight.\n\nIn Singapore, I have to say Changi cannot be beaten. It was still a very smooth experience, and brought back many childhood memories, not having changed much in 4 years imo. I had access to the lounge on my second flight, and I have to say the new KrisFlyer lounge is great. Good selection of food, and lots of seating.\n \nSQs medium haul business is smaller than their LH product, but is still very comfortable. I wish they modified their 787 seats to take advantage of the wider cabin on the A350, in business and economy. The bed is comfortable, and the seat is well designed overall. It's good to see this kind of product on medium haul/short haul flights.\n\nThe food on this flight was excellent. Had Laksa from the Book the Cook menu, and it was easily one of the best inflight meals I've had. The service on this flight was very different, much friendlier, and very attentive. All the crew went above and beyond on this flight. Although service standards are higher in business class, I do think the service definitely exceeded what I have experienced in business before. I wish these crew were deployed on the longer flights.\n\nOverall, after the pandemic, I'm left with mixed feelings about the airline. The first flight was very disappointing, nowhere near what my experience with them has been before. However, my second flight was great (although it was in business). This experience has definitely put me off flying SQ, and given my experience with EK this summer, I would definitely fly to India next time using the 3 big gulf carriers over SQ. I hope SQ really takes their service and catering more seriously, as I have been seeing other people complain about dropping standards too.",
                    "\"Enjoy complimentary rebooking for ALL TICKETS issued up to 31. December 2021\" . This is what Singapore Airlines advertises on their website. Well, it is not true !  When we changed (online not possible! ) our return flights (same flights, only 2 weeks earlier! )  and originally booked online with Singapore Airlines, we were charged extra. Asking why, they explained it with a different booking class..., on a flight to Singapore that was after all only about 10 % occupied, connecting flight from Singapore about 30 % occupied. After extra payment, new tickets were issued with a lower baggage allowance. Had to call them again, but you must know: The customer service is, if at all, almost not reachable by phone. On top of it, one suitcase did not arrive on time with our connecting flight.\nOverall: Quite unprofessional service and defenitely one way to loose customers for the future.\nBye Bye Singapore Airlines.",
                    "I had trouble right from the  free online 48 hour check in phase. I selected seats and was rejected. So I rang and eventually spoke to someone who told me that I would have to pay to make these seat selections because I had already made selections. He would not accept that I had not made any previous selections and would not answer my question of why I would have to pay in the free 48 hour window. I told him that I did not want the seats that had somehow already been allocated to me - he then stated that the flight was full and no changes were possible. I asked to speak to his supervisor. She then stated that airline policy is to allocate seats 72 hours before departure. I then asked what was the point of the free 48 hour seat allocation process which is on the airline's website? No answer.\nShe finally agreed to send an email to some other department asking whether my wife could be seated in the aisle seat in front of me rather than next to me, because we both wanted aisle seats on a long (15 hour) flight. No mention of the flight being full. She promised that I would receive a response that evening.\nLater, I received an email showing only me on the flight - my wife's booking had disappeared. I rang again, and was promised that she would be somewhere on the plane, but not necessarily near me. I stated that that was not good enough and that we wanted isle seats with her in front of me.\nAgain later that night, I received an email stating that she was now seated in an isle seat in front of me which is what we had requested. All good finally? NO. We got to the airport next morning, got our seat allocation tickets and my wife's seat was back next to me, not on the isle as stated. We asked whether this could be changed and were told all seats had been filled, including the promised seat in front of me. So we had been lied to both verbally and by email.\nWe then experienced the worst cabin service possible on the flight. We were second from the back and for some reason, were ignored when meals and liquid refreshments were issued. The cabin service seemed to start from in front of us. Eventually, we had to ask for the food and drinks that others had already received. The meals, once we had finally got them, were reasonable. That could not be said for the meals on the return flight from Vancouver to Singapore, then Singapore to Australia. They were almost inedible - mainly baked beans, some type of powdered egg and formed chicken which were barely even warm. We were told on both legs that they had run out of the popular meals, so we got what was left. If we had not been so hungry, we would have returned the meals. In addition, no drinks were served for the first 2 hours of the Singapore leg - again we had to ask for water.\nI also found food scraps on my fold up table, from the previous flight. There was also a food stain on the seat. It did raise questions about whether the area had been cleaned after the end of the previous flight - it was definitely a health regulation breach.\nSo it seems to us that Singapore Airlines are trying to do things cheaply by reducing service and food quality levels, and quite prepared to mislead customers over seat allocation procedures when queried. They used to be our preferred airline, but given our experiences on this return flight, we will never fly with them again. We would urge anyone thinking of booking with them to try another airline. They were once a reliable and quality brand, but we could not say that about them now.",
                    "Flew BKK to Sing and Sing to Perth. Food on both legs was adequate, champagne before take off and nice wines during the flight. More than enough leg room and privacy if needed. What made the legs special was the outstanding service, nothing was too much trouble. All staff I encountered were lovely, but must point out Chia from BKK to Sing and Kat from Sing to Perth; better than I've ever come across.",

I would like to thank one of the Japanese speaking crew from LAX to NRT for her outstanding service as I requested her to filled up my empty water bottles while she was busy assisting other passenger and will get back to me shortly I fell asleep and woke up 3 hrs later and she came to me and asked for my bottles for refilling.",

                    "SQ – the best airline ? – My Foot ! \n29th Nov '21 :  Called the helpline and asked if a puppy can travel on 9th Jan, London / Spore.  Was categorically told that YES, SPACE IS AVAILABLE and that I need to send details on email, which I promptly did in a few hrs n received an acknowledgement email.  \nAfter multiple phone calls and emails, they wake up on the 12th Dec after 14 days, and tell me no space available, despite categorically getting confirmation there was space ! Amazing competence indeed !  \nSpoke to various people on helpline and they say they cant do anything ! \nI am not just disappointed, but extremely upset. My partner is an animal lover and did not want to put the puppy through the 2 days ordeal / trauma by using pet movers and puppy in cargo etc...       Hence we waited to have the puppy hand carried, even before we paid and confirmed.

What kind of Policy prevents a person from talking directly to the team responsible ?  / prevents the staff from even giving an email id for complaints ?   or SQ deliberately wants it difficult for people to send complaints ? .\n = This is our national Carrier ? and we are supposed to feel bad for airlines impacted by Covid ? \n = Can anyone tell me how to reach someone in SQ who would care a damn ?",
                    "We travelled first class on the A380 from Singapore to London and had the absolute pleasure of what an amazing on board service. If you can ever do this, even once, do. We used points for this so whilst I do travel with work, we had saved hard to round off our honeymoon in style.\n\nNow to the fun stuff. We had just arrived on a business class flight from Osaka, it was red eye and we arrived at 5am into Singapore. After a little wonder round we headed to the highly anticipated lounge. Upon arrival, we were greeted by a friendly member of staff who saw our first class ticket and escorted us in. My wife went to the toilet and I ordered a tea, at this point my ticket was checked again. Fine. \nThe lounge has sleeping areas and we asked if we could use one of these given the 5 hours until our next flight. We were told no problem and as we walked over the lounge Manager came over and asked us for our boarding pass and passport again. At this point it's getting a bit weird and to be quite honest I'm feeling a little judged. I have flown first and business with many airlines for work and its a bit odd when you have to show your boarding pass 3 times. FIRST ISSUE.\n\nAbout an 30 minutes later, I am dosing and my wife is in the pod across from me and a man comes pushing through my door either blogging or talking to a friend on video. I jump out of bed and tell him in quite direct terms to get out. Half asleep I then notice he walks across and goes straight into my wife's room. It turns out she had been reading and was just getting ready to sleep. This man has walked straight past the lounge manager (who it turns out wasn't at her desk) and into my wife's room. If I hadn't of noticed the mind wonders as to what could have happened. \n\nWe are sickened by this experience as we were told that the rooms were monitored and the doors didn't lock unless specifically done. (Let's just say they were then locked). The way this incident was brushed off in the lounge was atrocious, no one wanted to take accountability and approach the man so for all I know he still has this footage. \n\nI submitted a feedback form 15 days ago and have followed up on the phone 3 times. At this point they have told me I need to wait for someone to get back to me. It ruined our experience that we had waited for, for 6 months as it was the last part of our honeymoon. \n\nThis is probably the longest review I have ever written and I know it doesn't apply to most but there are a few things to note. \n\n- lack of accountability of how this has affected us\n- judgemental staff\n- poor feedback team",

                    "I have booked SQ995 / SQ8530 from Medan Kualanamu (KNO) to Melbourne (MEL) from Tiket.com. To my horror, as I arrived to transfer at Changi Airport, SQ8530 is a Scoot flight. This is completely disgusting for SQ to sell a budget airline ticket as your own. If this is the level Singapore Airlines have stood down to, I am shocked and disgusted. No indication that this is a Scoot flight when I book this ticket.\n\nMy agony does not end here. As I arrive in Melbourne (12 Dec 11AM) , my luggage (which was checked in with me from Medan) does not arrive. \n\nAs I contact Singapore Airlines to take responsibility of them selling me a budget airlines ticket + my lost luggage, they replied that 4 digits SQ flight code is a Scoot flight and they expected me to know that. HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO KNOW THAT?\n\nFurthermore, Scoot’s baggage services confirmed that my baggage had finally arrived in Melbourne on 15 Dec 8.37AM on SQ227. HOWEVER THEY CANNOT DELIVER MY LUGGAGE BECAUSE SINGAPORE AIRLINES HAS NOT DELIVERED MY LUGGAGE TO THEM AS OF 10.30PM 15 Dec. THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS AFTER 72 hours without my travel essentials and clothing.\n\nSINGAPORE AIRLINES ALSO ARROGANTLY REFUSED TO COMPENSATE ME & TAKE RESPONSIBILITY. Indonesian Customer Service Adjie instead lectured me over email that 4 digits SQ Flight code is Scoot flight and expect me to know that.\nAdjie also mentioned that this baggage issue is not Singapore Airlines’ fault but Scoot’s. I booked Singapore Airlines tickets, even my bag tag number is SQ. this is outrageous\n\nI am a Singapore Airlines KF Frequent Flyer and my family and I have flown Singapore Airlines for years due to their reliability and quality.

                    "A solo male passenger can occupy a bassinet seat but the father to his baby couldn't?\n\nWe have traveled with Singapore Airlines a couple of times and enjoyed their services and will continue to do so following this review but we have experienced our first flight booking complication.\n\nOur travel plans were NZ to Vietnam. I was to stay for 4 week and my wife and baby are staying 8 weeks to spend longer with my wife's family. With our different return dates, this meant our flights were not able to be linked even with our departing itinerary being identical. Because of or tickets not all being linked together, we weren't able to be seated together on the flight from Auckland - Singapore (10 .5hr). Our travel agent informed us they were not able to link the ticket via the Singapore Airline system but they will note it on the itinerary for Singapore to amend, we were told to call Singapore close to our flight date (2 week prior) to ensure this is all correct and our seating will be together. Called Singapore and went through this with them, the rep I spoke to said they were not able to confirm this either. I asked if it was possible to book the bassinet seats together online but told I wouldn't be able to either, I was informed by the Singapore Airline rep to \"check-in\" on the day as early as possible and get seated together with a bassinet seat because this is where the final seating allocations are given if they were not all pre-allocated prior to airport check-in. At the airport check-in we went through this again but again were not able to be seated together (my wife, baby and me), the closest seat for me was to be about 4-5 rows back. Not a big help if our baby is not travelling well.\n\nWhy all the fuss.......\nThis is where I inform you, the reader that our 18 month baby has significant food allergies that causes her to vomit, breakout into hives and can in bad situation incur swelling to her mouth area and eyes. And yip we have had trips to the ED and are working with the hospital to establish how to control these. Got 2 hospital letters while away on holiday.\n\nSo, because of the above with our baby, we get a little stressed when outside our home area and this was to be our first flight with our baby (10.5hrs) with only the medicine we had with us, its safe to say we were nervous wreaks. On a positive note boarding the plane through NZ customs, they allowed all our babies home-cooked frozen meals, frozen breast milk and all her medicines that were all greater than 100mls each (2 months worth). Great work NZ Customs.\n\nThe negative reason for this review was who was in the bassinet seating area once we were all seated. In our cabin the bassinet seating's were, middle row of 4 seats - 2 EMPTY SEATS.... aarrrrrrrrrr. The 2 seats they gave us at Check-In on the day were at the rear of the plane but our little baby was the true superstar of the flight and had a great time and the passenger beside us was very accompanying of our situation  and we all had a nervous but good flight.\n\nThanks for reading.",

Being first class I find that totally unacceptable and though I’ve emailed them twice since July 2022, nobody has bothered to reply me. Their system have acknowledged receiving my email but no further actions. I’ve recently flown business from Sydney to Athens on Qatar airways n I highly recommend them. Excellent service!! Much better than 1st class on SIA!!",
                    "We travelled with Singapore airline from London Heathrow to Singapore and the lounge was fabulous, the exclusive security line was amazing and the zero queue to board was great. So we were very excited for when we would fly from Singapore (the home of the airline) to the Philippines.\n\nDon't get excited!! The business queue was still lengthy... Once we passed immigration we searched for the lounge and found it was in terminal 1... This was a train away and a totally different terminal from our gate. With 1hr 15 until boarding we really saw zero point and could not believe that so many flights for Singapore airlines.\n\nWe were so disappointed as we wanted to eat and drink before our flight and for the money we paid for ticket, we thought that would be no problem!\n\nIt got worse.. We headed to our gate to find no seperate queue for business and first class and we waited in a line for 45 minutes to board!\n\nIf I was paying even more for a first class seat I would be beyond furious.\n\nThe money we paid got us nothing more than a bigger seat and for that difference it is NOT WORTH IT AT ALL!!!\n\nWe had such high hopes and these tickets are far from cheap. It seems to home on the airline has very little to offer.",
                    "The flight itself was adequate, the food was mediocre at best, the service was appalling. Staff totally uninterested in assisting staff. The did it begrudgingly at best. \nWorse than that was the after service. \nI left something on the plane and wanted to see if it had been found. I know exactly where it was. I couldn't contact SA by phone because the number on their website is incorrect. I used their online form, sent emails and tweets, even Facebook, but no response whatsoever. I consider this extremely rude and very unprofessional. Absolutely appalling customer service.\nCircumstances meant I had to change my booking for a return flight. I've done this with other airlines without any issue whatsoever.\nSA had to prove their ineptitude yet again. They went out of their way to do it. I eventually had to call Australia to get things organised properly.\nI have complained and asked for an apology, but as per their arrogant customer service policy, they've just ignored me.\nI had flown SA before, and they were good. I expected so much better.\nI will not be using their services again in a hurry.\nI recommend everyone look elsewhere.",
                    "Everything is getting worse.  From the arrogant staff at Changi to the inflight service to the ticket prices this is getting to be a joke. I remember when it was a privilege to fly  this airline.  It is not just a post-covid hang over.  I stopped flying them to Europe as it was impossible to use my points to upgrade.   And then walking through business class to find it largely empty.",
                    "While queuing to board, I encountered that I did not have my boarding pass. I immediately informed the police officer who checking our ticket before boarding, and she took my passport and other boarding passes to a SIA agent. The SIA agent took a look at my passport and other boarding passes, she asked me a question that I did not know how to answer. She asked: Where was your boarding pass? Pardon? If I knew where was my boarding pass, do you think I wanted to make a hassle to come to you to ask for a new one? I just replied her: I don't know. \n\nWhile I was waiting for the toilet, a male cabin crew passed by in front of me. He came back again but accidentally hit me. He looked at me for 2 seconds without saying a word, and he walked off. Alright, I excused you. \n\nFinally, I arrived at my final destination, and my luggage was not there. We tried to contact SIA but they said it wasn't their problem anymore before we had a transit with Lufthansa to travel to our final destination. But, did I pay to Lufthansa? I made a purchase through SIA.\n\nAnyways, no one bothers to help us for our lost luggage. Thank you SIA for this \"wonderful\" experience.",
                    "I’ve flown with Singapore airlines on an annual basis for almost 16 years. My business class flight to KL via singapore was so remarkably bad, I had to post this review. Staff were pushy (served food while daughter was sleeping - in the old days they’d ask me for permission to service) messy with their service ( no coasters for drinks,food overflowing on plates) food was cold, bland and dry in some cases.  no amenities bag, no drinks on take off, no longer serving satays… felt like the attention to detail that was always something Singapore airlines mastered was now an after thought. I forked put £11 k for this this experience and yes i do feel like  i’ve been cheated. Trying to get back to malaysia after spending 5 months in my home town London ( my mum passed away) I was eager to get back to my husband and son \n\nI’m heading back to London in july and i will choose to travel with another airline. I can’t believe i’d ever say this but singapore airlines - you were dreadful and i can’t believe you are able to charge this sort of price and get away with it",
                    "Absolutely appalled by what is supposedly the best airline in the world. We booked our flights for our honey moon in July ‘22 and upgraded to extra legroom (my soon to be husband is 6”6 so a necessity for 16 hours of flying). A month ago we just an update that the flight number had been changed but notice that anything serious had happened. When looking at details to plan hotels I noticed that the outbound flight had been moved from Singapore to Manchester, leaving us for 52 hours in Singapore airport with no compensation, no hotel and no information. After complaining they were able to move the flight from Bali to Singapore out by a day leaving us for 5 hours in the airport but all legroom seats had been taken. \n\nAgain no compensation offered however they did say they could offer a complimentary refund on the legroom upgrade that we wouldn’t be able to use for the outbound flight… which is incidentally a legal requirement as they have not honoured the service paid for. \n\nWe will not be flying with Singapore airlines again and unless they can resolve the issues we’ve had so far, we will be requesting a full refund.",

After I had booked my expensive premium economy seats, I get an email saying they have 'changed the plane\" but no indication that my initial booked seats are at risk. Several weeks, I happened to log in and see that my previous seats, with my family where we have dual aisle access, has turned into one where my wife and son are stuck in the two middle seats and I am stuck far off in a window seat. WTF?!?! And this for a premium seat? And now the cabin is mostly full. I wait over an hour to speak to someone to fix this, and they tell me they need 3 days to figure out options. And three days later - nothing! I am now on my third hour with these people. This is completely unacceptable.",

When turned up to airport 2 1/2 hours earlier the airline has given the seat to another. No other seats were available and was forced to fly economy in an overnight flight. Dreadful experience, very badly treated and after many emails of complaints for 3 weeks got an apology!\n\nThey take your money and sell you a service. Then when you try to receive the service, it’s not honoured. You are given vouchers to upgrade next time. So you have to buy tickets and fly again to upgrade!\n\nThese corporations need to be governed better and held responsible.\n\nBeware!",
                    "They damaged my bag (deliberate, forceful opening of bag) and after many months emailing them, they still haven't paid a cent in damages. Business class was such a rip off - felt like it was marginally better than Economy class.",
                    "Regardle, I personally had the worst experience traveling with Singapore Airline. Being on plane was excellent, food was good and crew were good. Unfortunately, I recommend everyone not to purchase a ticket or travel with Singapore Airline. They take advantage of your situation. I paid $960, round trip from LAX to KTM even paid extra $40 so there are no processing fees for any future changes. I had death in my family therefore had to stay longer in nepal. I explained & asked Singapore Airline to extend my date. They simply said are sorry I had to extend and  send me the quote of $1299. Finally had to cancel as other Airline were sending with lot cheaper. Worst in humanitarian action ever",

                    "This was our last leg of our flights home to Brisbane. \nWe had a 12hr layover in Singapore Changai due to the connecting flight out JFK NY being 3hrs late and Singapore airlines rebooking us due to this. \nThey emailed us the morning before the flight to let us know. Noy good having a 12hr layover but they did there best to get us a connecting flight which is good.\nThe flight left a few minutes late as they didn't open the lounge / gate until 40mins before the flight and everyone had to be screened to get through to the gate. We got off about ten minutes late but this was made up in the flight so we landed on time.\nWe were allocated seats 58A&B and were one of the last groups to board. It was a full flight but we still had some space for our bags above us in the overhead luggage bins. We had someone next to us so we couldn't spread out.\nThe crew were excellent and served the meal after taking off. After the meal, the lights were dimmed and I then accessed the excellent inflight entertainment system and watched some movies on it.\nThe staff were on the ball and were constantly bring water and juice around for the whole flight.\nThe only downside to the flight were some inconsiderate people sitting in front of us and putting seats back when you were trying to eat. The crew were excellent and pulled them up on this. Some people just need to be more aware of what they are doing and respect other passengers. \nOverall, the flight was good with little turbulence only.\nI love flying Singapore airlines as the planes are clean and well serviced, the crew is fantastic, always polite and courteous and ensure the comfort of there guests.\nthis was highlighted by the flight stewardesses cuddling a baby when the mum was trying to get ready to get off the plane. The genuine care you could see from the staff was excellent. I cant recommend Singapore Airlines enough.",
                    "Boarded in Brisbane Australia traveling to Phuket Thailand with a stopover in Singapore for 50 minutes\nThe seat's were so cramped together unfortunately I was stuck in the middle seat I was literary shoulder to shoulder with the other passengers (also they complained of room) we had no leg room  what's so ever my most uncomfortable flight I've ever experienced. When we touch down in Singapore there was no announcement or anyone of the Singapore staff to direct you to your next flight gate for a connecting flight to Phuket we were supposed to have 50 minutes layover time I checked the transfer board as soon as we landed it read boarding now the gate was b10 literally 1 km away I had to run the whole way and just made the flight many people around me running to connect with the same flight the most unorganised and uncomfortable flight I've ever been on I would never consider flying again with Singapore Airlines \nIf only I have read reviews on this airline I would have never purchased a ticket\nI am dreading frying back to Australia in 3 weeks. With this airline",
                    "Booked a family trip from Uk to Australia via Singapore, Premium Economy, almost a year in advance. Chose the flights due to time of flights, length of stopover and price.\nPrior to flying, the airline changed the flights on 7 different occasions. Changes were substantial meaning we had to completely change our holiday plans which incurred a lot of costs, cancelling and rebooking hotels (obviously the airline said it wasn’t their problem) We lost the capacity to sit together, as flights were changed once everyone else had booked seats. We were also booked onto ridiculous alternative flights with stupid transfer times which were always going to be unattainable. On each occasion I spoke to the airline, they were unapologetic and had a general attitude that I should be grateful they were helping me at all.\nUnsurprisingly the flights didn’t work and we missed connections. The airline was again unapologetic ( they say the word sorry but do nothing). We were bumped onto economy flights and told they didn’t give compensation. On the economy flights we were seated next to the toilets and there wasn’t enough food to give us a meal. Again we were told they don’t give compensation. \nI flew Singapore 20 years ago and it was great. It’s a very different airline these days and is purely living off its past reputation. Won’t use them again.",
                    "We used SQ  875 from Hong Kong to Singapore for transit  and SQ 964 from Singapore to CGK international airport in Indonesia, This is used to be the best Airlines. First of all it was delayed for 3 hours at the Hong Kong Airport with no air conditions in the mid of Summer in Hong Kong. The AC was on after the plan started to move. This delayed cause us to missed our connecting flight in Singapore. Arrive in Hong Kong again we had to wait inside the airplane for 45 minutes due to technical problems again with no air conditions. Now because of that we are booked on the next flight in which of course being 2 hours late, it is a good thing that are in side Changi Airport. The airport is not that great like people saying. Hong Kong new airport and Doha international airport is way better than Changi. I have to tell you about this airport too. Now after being 2 hours late they told us to go to Gate 69 in which we wait patiently with the other passenger and crew. Long behold on the boarding time, a staff came and spoke to the crew and the crew announced that the gate was changed to Gate 29. That is a 40 mins walked with no official announcement. By the way at Gate 29 it will still say SQ  964 and the official airport announcement  board is still on Gate 69. This is the worst airlines experience that we had, this is way worst than Lion Air or Pakistan International Air. Singapore Airlines make these airlines looks way better. So we cancelled our return flight and only got 50% back after all of the fine, currency exchange etc even though we cancelled it 3 weeks before our returned flight. I recommended Avoid using Singapore Airlines at all cost. We changed to Cathay Air from CGK to HK and its a very nice experience with cheaper ticket price with a wonderful crew and better meal. Again Do Not use this airlines, you will regret it.",

To make matters worse I could not change my allocated seats even if I wanted to pay. On all legs I was give the last row near the toilets. When I arrived in Sydney I found 4 of my suite cases damaged I have to buy more. My advise would be to choose another airline.",

He was super attentive. \nAlso, on the way back, their communication was so strong that everyone was aware of our issue 3 weeks earlier and they had noted our names. This is called professional service and true hospitality. Things will not always go as planned and as perfectly but what matters is the action taken to make things right, the solutions you offer, the approach and I must say, all things considered, Singapore Airlines was one of my best flight experience. \nSpecial thanks to Belinda as well 🙏🏼🙏🏼",
                    "A 2 hour '\"window\" from Phuket to link with SQ 231 from Singapore to Sydney. Runway repairs at Phuket delayed the plane by about 1 hour. Then they stuffed around for about another 45 minutes to find a different loading gate and get passengers loaded. Minimal information on what was happening.. Upon landing at Singapore the plane sat on the tarmac for about 20 minutes as they could not find the ground traffic controller to direct the plane to the loading slot. It is now about 1.00 am .By this time SQ 231 to Sydney scheduled to 00.45 has left Singapore. Singapore guy lakes us to their reservation counter and eventually offers to change us to SQ 241 scheduled for 7.15 next morning . We ask what are we to do in the meantime - he says just do your best. - no offer of accommodation or any thing. To make matters worse I have paid for premium economy and SQ 241 has no premium economy. I suggest an upgrade to Business - minimal response . then after a significant amount of \"discussion\" he agrees to the upgrade - which also gives access to the business lounge which is a better place to spend the 5 hour  wait period. And when I finally get on SQ 241 only about 15 of the 40 odd business seats are occupied. A nice flight to Sydney but as a final blow I get a gastro infection from the plane food . Have survived 3 weeks of Thai street food with no issues but no the air plane food",

So, I would advise travellers to check their booking with Singapore Air carefully. You can find yourself on a budget Scoot flight.",
                    "1, I did 4 legs with the Airline but the last leg was terrible! \nFull flight with lots of special meals and kids! By the time the crew handed out all specials and kids meals it was 3 hour later before we even got a drink! Never mind the meal and no choices! For a 5.5 hour flight, not good! Was not happy! I have complained to Singapore Airlines but no response! Not very good customer service there! \n2. Most Airlines give you 2 suitcases of 23kg! This airline 1 suitcase of 25kg. Then they charge US$50 per kg! Wow! What an outrage! I was charged an horendous amount! Complained and again no response! Pretty sad for a renowned  Good Airine! This was outrages! This would seriously make me think about flying with them again or recommend them!",
                    "As we had booked directly with Singapore Airlines we had expected a high standard of comfort and\nservice delivery across all legs of our journey. Indeed, the summary of fare conditions made specific\nreference as to what we would ‘enjoy’ from the SCOOT operated leg of our journey with ‘check in\nbag allowance and complimentary hot meal’. However, what Singapore Airlines failed to mention is\nwhat we would not enjoy on SCOOT!\nPerhaps what Singapore Airlines should include in their summary of fare conditions is that; ‘you will\nbe travelling with SCOOT for part of your itinerary and you will not enjoy the:\nI. the chaotic boarding procedure\nII. The rude staff\nIII. The denial of basic amenities, such as water (unless you pay for it)!\nIV. The complimentary meal, which was totally inedible\nV. The filthy travel conditions (SCOOT planes are most definitely not cleaned)\nVI Toilets leaking into the body of the plane causing puddles of water on the carpets \nVII. The lack of CoVid19 precautions (travellers not wearing masks and this not addressed by SCOOT staff)\nVIII The lack of inflight entertainment\nVIIII. The extremely long wait at the baggage claim\nThis was without doubt the worst flight conditions I have ever experienced and to have to endure 7\n½ hours + of this at the end of a long haul flight was unbearable",

As they say let your feet do the talking",

                    "Our unpleasant experiences with Singapore Airlines began with booking. The return date changed without my husband noticing until after he had pressed the pay button. He immediately contacted the airline, but they would only do the change if we paid $600 Cdn. Outrageous. We declined. The flight from Penang to Singapore was not very business class and I had to get an extension for my seatbelt, which I have never had to do before or after. International flyers use those planes not just tiny Asians. The flight from Singapore to Seoul had a typical arrangement of seats but when I notice we had not received a complimentary kit I asked for one. The steward brought two and I almost laughed out loud. They were a little pocket with a couple things inside. Boy is that a joke compared to other business class airlines. Overall, I would rate this airline below Air Canada, Qatar, and Emirates.",
                    "I Made a mistake on booking an upgrade, tried to get SA to cancel like within 20minutes. I upgraded the wrong flight! But at the same time I was half asleep and didn’t think SA would ask to if I wanted to upgrade on a short leg of my trip, and the second leg of my trip. They would not help, quoted T&Cs, spoke to me like robots who read from a check sheet. No compassion horrible service. Clearly terrified of showing any compassion. I didn’t want a free flight or anything, I just want to cancel the upgrade. Will never fly SA again, the onboard service is always the best, but let down my politics and office staff. \n\nTo just quote T&Cs all the time and take the stance they have, is some big company bully. T&Cs that clearly protect them but not the customer. They state they can cancel an upgrade when ever the want, but same reversed they can’t!  These people forget that without the customers there is no company. And from time to time, idiots like me make a mistake! Just another robot company, in it for the money and nothing else.",

There wasn't any air vent hole for u to control the cold air blowing at you. But seems to come from the top. It's more like a dehumidifier setting rather than aircon . I saw ppl around me all fanning themselves! \n\nYes ppl have to fan themselves like in the 80s where buses have no aircon , hot stuffy and soaking with perspiration atvthe end of the 5-6hr flight!!!\n\nWill not take this flight ever again , horrible experience!",

Worst flight experience ever. Staff were extremely unfriendly at the luggage drop off. When I went from Melbourne to Singapore the Australian women who worked for the company was yelling at us like we were cattle and she had a very patronising tone with some other customers which I felt was almost racist. \n\nThis occurred because Singapore airlines changed my flight from Singapore to scoot. They still charged me as though it was a Singapore airlines flight. They even printed my ticket out with the Singapore Airlines logo. I don't get why companies can't just be straight up honest with you about there product? Like if it was going to be a scoot flight then just say that? I'm sure it was written in the fine print, which covers them in other areas, but not in common decency. They even printed \"Singapore airlines\" on my boarding past.  \n\nAnyway, in my books definitely not a good, reliable high quality company. They will change your flights around and don't care about quality.",
                    "We booked and paid 11 months in advance so that we could get the seats we wanted, and pre-paid for extra legroom seats.  Even though the aircraft type has not changed, Singapore airlines moved our seats without permission.  I would bet good money that they did so for greed, and no other reason.  Unless you want the same thing to happen to you, consider flying another airline.  No more business for Singapore Airlines from us.",

                    "Airbus A380 LHR-SIN was great, very clean, spacious seats in econ and the CC were excellent. Food is a choice of Chicken or Noodles with fish, both were very good, plenty of drinks on offer and a good standard of service. CC very professional. Toothbrushes available in the toilets and earplugs / eyeshades available from CC if you ask.\nIFE is brilliant, headphones and cleaning kit given out prior to boarding.\n\nFlight departed on time, landed early. Singapore airport is awesome.\n\nAirbus A350 SIN-MNL again, a new aircraft, very clean and every bit as good as the previous leg. Boarding is ordered, well organised and slick.\n\nAirbus A350 MNL-SIN - As above.\n\nBoeing 777-300  SIN-LHR Very old and sadly tired out 777 on the night flight ex SIN to LHR. Seats were hard and worn, headrest was stiff and uncomfortable and overall it was a very tired plane. IFE was still very good however.\nFood was still very good, CC excellent and of a very high standard.",
                    "Excellent service from Singapore airlines in Australia, but Manila terrible. Luggage tagged to Melbourne instead of final destination of New Zealand and told to claim and re check in there, but I didn’t have a visa to enter Australia so could not pick my luggage up and hence missed my connecting flight as there was arguments between Singapore airlines and Air New Zealand of who was responsible for this . The fault was Singapore airlines in Manila should have checked it right through to NZ Thank god the girls at Singapore Airlines in Melbourne were absolutely fantastic!!  Arranged nice hotel accommodation for me , meals taxi service , and got my on another flight the next day they were brilliant !!!!  Can’t praise them enough, very very professional. But as for Manila , they really need some proper training!!!!!!!! I won’t be using SIA to fly SE Asia again.",
                    "Even though it was a double-decker Airbus, boarding and disembarking where both pretty efficient, which is always a boon. Seats and legroom pretty good for Economy, but I do feel that we won the cattle-class lottery by getting 3 seats between the 2 of us - I'm not sure how well I would have coped with 12+ hours in a full row. Unless you can afford an upgrade, I doubt that you'll do much better than with SA.",
                    "We purchased a Round The World Fare with the Star Alliance. \nI was very disappointed with the seats and the level of service that Singapore Airlines provided. Given that we paid double the Economy fate, what we were supplied with was hardly better than economy.  There was no extra space to make a long trip more comfortable. There were no wee extras like Air NZ provided,  the lounge for Koru Club members was not available as it has a SG code- even though we booked with AirNZ . \nI would never pay extra for Premium Economy with Singapore Airlines again. A waste of good money.",
                    "As this second leg of our trip coincided with my birthday my son treated my wife and I to a First class flight to Melbourne. He had previously flown to the UK in first. And wanted us to experience the high class service he had e perienced. Unfortunately it was not be be. Our seats were 1D and 1F and were spacious and comfortable enough for the 7 hour flight. The on board welcome was up to expectations for first class passenger of which there were only 4. The service was no more than OK, however my Lobster Thermidor book the cook meal was excellent. Not so my wife’s beef which was difficult to cut into. The amenity kit contained creams and lotions plus eye mask, socks and slippers. Value for money not really. We returned this week from Melbourne on Qatar Airways in business class which knocked the spots off Singapore Air’s First class service.",
                    "First time in Singapore Airlines economy in about 5 years.\nStandard of service has declined terribly.\nNo pre-dinner drinks on the Singapore-London sector. Used to look forward to a Singapore sling. No offering of topping up your wine glass. One slosh in a cheap plastic cup and that is your ration. Used to get offered port or liquors in the second run of the drinks cart. The drinks cart never returned after the meal so too bad if you wanted a coffee. No menu card. Some items supposed to be available not on the cart. Were told if we wanted those options they would have to be heated up. Starting to get the drift - really terrible.\nSeat on the Melbourne-Singapore sector wouldn't recline. Very limited leg room on both sectors. Passenger next to me had to sit sideways.\nCan't understand what had happened. Ticket prices are expensive yet service has been slashed.\nI note a number of other bad reviews on TA so I hope Singapore Airlines is taking notice.",
                    "During this 12-hour flight, I got my period, the toilets do have an amenities draw so I was able to utilise this. There was blood on my olive-green jeans that was very obvious. The staff of the flight gave me a dress to put on and then proceeded to clean the blood off my jeans. They did and then gave them back just as it was time to start preparing for landing. Who on earth would do this? The flight attendants were just so lovely and discreet. i cannot commend them enough for this as I had another 5-hour flight to go in my journey. Thank you ever so much Singapore Airlines, I highly recommend this airline for travel, economy was still very comfortable and we did no go hungry.",
                    "I was very happy with this airlines for my honeymoon. We left shortly after the passengers were loaded meaning we got off the ground ahead of schedule and landed ahead of schedule. This happened with all our flights, and they had information available in flight about connecting flights so we didn't need to stress about finding our way in an unknown airport. The crew was very friendly and helpful.",
                    "Had heard great things but service and quality of seating far inferior to that of BA. Food terrible and don't believe it was any different to economy. Poor and slow service. No flight socks, eyeshades, etc. Would not recommend on the basis of this flight.",
                    "For the life of me I don't get why this airline receives good reviews. The check in procedures are appalling, the aircraft seats (yes I am acknowledge I am sitting in the lowest class available on the aircraft) are fine as long as you're not an adult male taller than 175 centimetres and as for the famous cabin attendants - they are as officious as any you would have expected to need to communicate with on an areoflot flight from the soviet era. I'm sure they're charming in business class and probably civil in prem. economy but they clearly don't care much about the other 70% of passengers. I write this as I sit and wonder why I chose to fly Singapore over Thai, Malaysian or Vietnam airlines (all of who provide headphones and blankets without having to ask for them.) I never will again that much is certain. An abomination of an airline.",
                    "When did Singapore become no frills? I Al not a fan of writing bad reviews but….\n\nI’ve always rated Singapore Air number one. No longer. Definitely now a budget airline and  with a premium tariff. \n\nService is still lovely but don’t bother forking out for business. It’s the new economy. Very BYO. PJs, travel kit all those extras that you to forward to when you go premium are gone. Definitely don’t get what you pay for. Disappointing. \n\n",
                    "I fly internationally on long-hauls from Aus to Europe annually. Have used 5 different carriers over 13 years, this is the 1st time with Singapore.\nThe positives, the aircraft over 2 legs, (A350 + 787) were in good condition with good entertainment systems \nBut the food... \n1st leg approx 7hrs. A bag of dried peas, and then a lunch tray table that was half empty, Nasi Goreng. Soggy chicken pie prior to landing.\n2nd flight, a cardboard take-out carton with Beef Ragu, inedible, all fat and cartlidfe. My wife and I were shocked.\n\nMale stewards as arrogant as door-men at a club, females cold, deep sigh when i pressed the call button once to ask for water.\n\nI don't know who to judge: Singapore Airlines for prioritising covid measures (incl their hiring policies) over merit, or the dozens of Aussies who told me with wide-eyed awe that SA were \"the best\".\n\nPlease note, this is my first review of a carrier, I've never bothered before.\nBut you pay a premium for these guys.\nEven if Emirates sits you on a dated 777, and the service is starting to slip, the food is still an easy one to get right \nQatar is still the best all rounder, and Korean Air (while years ago) was a great experience \n\nJust manage your expectations i guess",
                    "Always pleasant and feel great comfort flying with Singapore Airlines. And if you want extra pampering and eat the finest food while flying, upgrade to their Business Class. Highly recommended if you have a small one, the space is a big factor. \n\nThanks to all the lovely staff especially Kelly and Eileen. They always attend on your request for your kids. They are just absolutely stars! \n\nOn the side note, SIA lounges are really full but it’s still got great food. Hopefully in the future, they will offer kids corner where the little ones can play and burn energy 😜",
                    "I booked via Priceline. Prem economy. Service received was economy. A lady who paid economy fare had better seat. \nI was seated at the back. Overrated airline. I had star alliance gold. Only thing that was good was the lounge. \nTry Eva air got prem economy. Much better.",
                    "One of the absolute best flights I have ever taken. We were rerouted onto Singapore Airlines business due to weather conditions at our original transfer airport. The staff were fantastic and super attentive. The food was phenomenal. One small gripe, the seat has a very small area for your feet and unless your a side sleeper, is difficult to use. But otherwise it is a great seat and a great airline and I fully understand why they are the best airline of 2023 according to Skytrax.",
                    "After reading some of the horror stories on here, I was a bit worried, but my flights went smoothly, and as a gold Velocity member was able to enjoy the Sydney SilverKris lounge prior to my outbound flight, as well as the recently renovated KrisFlyer gold lounge in Changi T3 which is now greatly improved. \n\nI travelled on a B777-300ER outbound and Airbus A350 for the return, both in economy and found both to be clean and in good order. The cabin crew were friendly, professional and attentive on both flights. The only real change post covid-19 was the food was not as plentiful as before, and no hot towel was provided. In particular on SQ221, the overnight return SIN-SYD, it was annoying that only dinner is now served - they used to also serve a light breakfast prior to the arrival into Sydney - even a coffee would have been better than the nothing which was provided. \n\nWhile they are great in the air, they are horrible with customer service over the phone to organise/manage bookings. I was making another booking and there was a website error, and when I called the Australian call centre, they wanted to charge an extra couple of hundred dollars or so than the price the website was displaying, saying their system was what mattered and it didn't matter what the website was saying. Isn't advertising a price and then not honouring it illegal under Australian Consumer Law? As I was in Singapore, I was able to visit them in person, and there thankfully they were sensible and realised I should be charged the price the website says even and were able to override their back-end system which said no availability at that price-point. I don't know what I would have done if I hadn't been able to visit in person though; I probably would have referred them to Department of Fair Trading or the ACCC or similar for advertising a price on the website as being available, and refusing to honour it when you get to the very final step of payment.",
                    "Biz class with lie flat bed, but it is at an angle. Either you have to pivot at the hips so your feet fits the slot or you lie on your sides. It was not comfortable.\n\nLounge was Wing Tips, not a premium location. Flying Club no longer used for SQ?\n\nServices in the plane were good. Tried the SIA Kris Sling drink. Meal was fine, pre ordered steak. No satay dish.",
                    "The best service, best hospitality, and the staffs are very polite. Felt very warm and welcomed throughout the flight. 100% recommend.",
                    "Comfortable seats, great service, good food, good entertainment system. One of the best international airlines. ",
                    "Had not flown with them before and haven't flown with them since so this review is based on my one experience to date....\n\n..and it was pretty good. Everything flowed along nicely - this was in the middle of a lot of COVID19 issues - and the staff were very professional and courteous. The flight went off without a hitch, the food was better than I'd expected (it had been some years since my last long haul flight) and I'd happily fly with these guys again.",
                    "Flown many times with SQ. No complaints, just compliments. Staff are fantastic. Food is adequate. Wine from Chile very nice. \n\nOf course in economy room is limited. \n\nOf flight entertainment is great and easy to use. \n\nFinally, always feel safe. \n\nSingapore, the country, should be proud with their achievements. \n\nPlenty to see and do. \n\nPeople are marvellous. Helpful!!\n\nAnd racial harmony, as it should be.",
                    "Was expecting better from Singapore airlines but premium economy is nothing besides a bigger seat. Food was just ok, No amenities kit, not a great selection of entertainment. The poor passenger in front of me had a seat that wouldn’t recline. Overall it was not worth the price. Definitely have had better experience with other airlines. Only saving grace was the ground staff and flight attendants were wonderful. ",
                    "Third flight of 4 we have on this trip and this was the worst though none have been very good.\nSeats - very uncomfortable with large gaps between rear of the seat; cushion too thick so uncomfortable; a stupid calf extender which adds nothing to the comfort on a long haul.\nDrinks service - very poor. Plastic cups for gin & tonic and also wine! Really? In Premium. Even worse with 2nd drinks service as wine given in cardboard cup as ran out of plastic. White wine was only Chardonnay- no choice! In Premium?\nMeals - bland.\nEntertainment- very poor and limited choice of both films and tv shows.\n\nWill never book Singapore for Premium again.",
                    "The 737Max 8 was a excellent aircraft with very spacious legroom. It quite and stable. And is safe.\nOnly that the food is served in a tub which looks very unrepresentable and like a junk food.",
                    "Terrible experience I don't wish to anyone. My 7 yo daughter and I weren't sitting together and they didn't do anything to sort things out. My daughtercried for 3 hours!!! And didn't sleep at all. ",
                    "Overall experience was very good. Covid has played hell with the airlines and people's expectations. The Standard of this airline may have slipped a bit.",
                    "We travelled from London to Melbourne and Auckland back to London in Business Class. The service was impeccable and the food and drinks service superb. Through the night the staff checked to see if we needed anything if we were awake.\nI was so surprised to find the Business Class seats uncomfortable. You have to lie diagonally with your feet in a small space and the seat was hard. Before retiring I used to fly globally on business and this is one of the most uncomfortable journeys I have had.",
                    "Their crew is nice & polite but the service is not enough on a 19 hour flight you need food too. The food was not great. Their quality & quantity has deteriorated in the past 10 years of my flying experience with them. But the crew has definitely been good and the service is 10/10. ",
                    "best in class for service, seat comfort, aircraft age etc. Much better that its blue rival from Amsterdam which is dreadful......",
                    "Singapore airlines is known to be very strict all around, which is great in terms of flight safety. I enjoyed the feeling of safety and comfort during the flight. \n\nHowever, I’m not sure I’d recommend them otherwise, at least not for premium economy. I flew once on regular economy and it was okay.\n\nHowever, my flight in premium economy was disappointing. Cathay is MUCH better for this class. Seats are much wider and have a much greater foot rest extension on Cathay. Your feet barely lift off the ground on Singapore Airlines. As well, Cathay has much better food. SA food made me very sick. Cathay also provides a welcome drink and amenity kit. I was very disappointed because SA advertises that they give this to premium economy, yet I did not receive either. \n\nTo top it off, flight attendants decided to come up with a crafty lie once they were caught being racist :)",
                    "The lounge was disappointing and felt untidy and the food on offer was ok. Boarding was disjointed with me being handed off between three different crew members. The suite was nice but the leather felt dirty. The staff were far too over the top and this did not feel genuine but rather subservient. Feel that other airlines do much better at genuine customer service. SQ needs to review their uniforms as the women’s tops and skirts all looked way too tight and that style is now rather dated. The men’s suits all looked modern in comparison. The Lalique toiletries were lovely. The menu selection was vast and the best part of the entire flight. \nOne of my bags was badly damaged. It was brand new and I inadvertently had two photos to prove tgat at the airport the bag was not damaged. I had NOTHING BUT ISSUES with SQ. They insisted I claim this on my travel insurance despite proof that the damage was caused buy them/an agent acting for them. I had staff members be incredibly rude and even lie to me. I have never had such horrific treatment. \nI’d never spend this amount of money with SQ again. In fact, I’ll never fly with them again. SQ staff are substandard.",
                    "We had 2 flights  in a  row - around 24 hours - and therefore we had chosen the expensive version in business class. It is expensive - but everything  is also perfect as  I see it. Service is  in top - and food and wines very, very good.\nIt will for us be depressing to go on longhaul trips in economy class afterwards-",
                    "Please please reopen your lounge in BKK\n\ncurrently (Aug2022) you are sharing the Thai air lounge which is possibly one of the worse in the world. Very sadly the Thais have very poor lounge service in their own flagship home hub. Their staff are nice but the food is inedible and connectivity not good enough for me to work. I travel a lot for work.",
                    "This was the worst airline we have ever flown with. We were so disappointed having heard such good reviews from others. I feel they used covid as an excuse for terrible service. The food was disgusting - this was a flight from Manchester- all food was for asian market - i.e chicken porridge, shrimp cakes etc. one hour into our 14 flight we were told to put our blinds down ( it was 11am England time) all lights were turned off and we didn't see any flight crew - or any service for the next 10 hours. Disgraceful service. Yes, you could buzz for service but you were made to feel like you were disturbing them. This flight was so expensive - would never want to fly with Singapore Airlines again",
                    "Singapore Airlines has always evoked a sense of safety and comfort. I have always enjoyed their flights and their care. So, as usual, I once again booked my family on the Singapore Economy for our vacation to NZ. \nRight now on board SQ 285 from Singapore to Auckland. Two hours into the flight, no drinks, no food offered till now. I had to press the service button to get a glass of water and the crew wasn't very welcoming. My wife also pressed the button for some water, no one came. She got up,  walked back n git her water.\nI don't know, whether Singapore Airlines has deliberately lowered the service standards in Economy to push sale Premium Economy,  but for sure there is a marked deterioration to the earlier famed Singapore Air hospitality.",
                    "The food selection on Singapore Airlines has declined so much as now all eastern food with noodles etc which is not my favorite. Your food used to be tops, I have travelled with Singapore Airlines from 2000 over 10 times and always enjoyed the food so much. I do not understand why the menu has changed so much. The seats on the economy A350-900 much smaller than the seats on the 777-200 EUR which used to fly to JNB.  The Food is not up to slandered. ",

She made sure everything was taken cared of and even brought my mother to the business class lounge in the wheelchair. The MAAS, meet and assist service is top notch. \n\nI would like to congratulate the Singapore Airlines team and SYD Airport for having such an amazing team member. \n\nPlease congratulate Linda and thank her for us.

                    "We flew the SQ 322 flight from Singapore to London Heathrow on Tuesday 2nd august 2022 arriving at London Heathrow at 6am. \n\nWhen we got on the flight the seat part of my daughters chair was missing. She was seated in 54k next to the window. Somebody came and replaced it so she could sit down. We all fell asleep immediately as it was almost 1am in the morning Sydney time. Half way through the flight my daughter realised her socks were wet. We had a look at them and realised they stank of vomit. We then checked all of her toys and our bags that were on the floor and they were all damp and stank of vomit.\n\nAll of her things, shoes, socks and bottom of her trousers just absolutely stank of vomit and the ground was soaking wet.\n\nI can not believe that after such a terrible pandemic my daughter was allowed to sit in an area where someone had so obviously recently been vomiting. Not to mention how disgusting it has been travelling to our hotel in a car with bags all covered in sick and smelling absolutely terrible. \n\nI complained to the air steward and asked her to make a note as it was such a disgusting way to have to sit on a long haul flight.\n\nWe then of course all began vomiting the day after the flight, having been sat in clearly a gastro covered area.   Our short UK holiday absolutely ruined, not being able to see my terminally ill father for 8 days in fear of passing it to him, which his immune system could not have handled.   This after not seeing him due to the pandemic for 3 years! \n\nI understand we flew economy, but at the very least we expected the seats to be clean and sanitary. \n\nI emailed the airline through my husbands official Singapore Airlines account, and we heard nothing.  I emailed several times, nothing.  I only got a response from the airline when I involved a third party resolver government site that helps consumers.  They told me nothing had been reported, and that the airline staff deny this even happened.\n\nSo at the very least they are not logging and recording the changing of seats which must be a safety issue.  I find very hard to believe the air steward doesn't remember covering the vomit floor with a blanket and spraying ai freshener over it for us.  I also asked her to log it all, and she said she would.  The airline said all the attendants had been interviewed but they all deny this even happened.  \n\n It's not so much what happened, it is more the absolute  denial that it even took place.  Had I of known they had not logged my complaint on the flight, I would have asked fellow passengers for witness statements - but who would ever imagine they would need to that! \n\nPlus it has taken 3 months for them to look into this for me!!\n\nWe will never ever fly Singapore airlines again.",

We were placed in a hotel by SQ adjacent to the airport for a sudden 24hour plus layover near midnight with a \"food coupon\" that we had to fight for as we were starving due to the long delay and no food service on the plane. After arriving at the hotel we found out that those food vouchers were not even valid according to the hotel, Capri by Fraser, and no food service was available. Capri by Fraser's on duty manager in Singapore apparently said they don't take \"food coupons\" from Singapore Airlines for emergency layover guests and that this was a miscommunication with SQ. At near midnight where nearly all restaurants were closed and Capri is far from the city center, how were we expected to get a meal after being misled by Singapore Airline staff at the airport about the availability of food and their miscommunication? What if we were first time guests in Singapore with no knowledge of the local language and not able to navigate the situation? This is a complete failure from a management perspective as delayed passengers who miss connecting flights after a certain time at night should at least be informed properly if not put in a hotel with 24 room service/dining options in or nearby and given the courtesy of not having to worry about starving on top of rearranging travel plans etc. For an airline with a world class reputation where one pays a premium for the service this just is not acceptable.\n\nI submitted a complaint to Singapore Airlines but their complains team threw a response back at me: “as much as we acknowledge the inconvenience you went through as a result of the delay, as an industry practice, and in line with our Conditions of Contract and Carriage, we would like to share that airlines generally do not compensate for consequential losses or inconvenience arising from flight delays.” However, I know international passenger rights stemming from Article 19 of the Montreal Convention which covers delays due to fault of the airline. SQ senior customer service staff repeatedly mislead and misrepresent int'l passenger rights trying to essentially brush me off.\n\nThere is a lot more to this story but currently they have ceased responding to my emails and appears to think that ignoring the issue will fix it. I don't know what more I can do at this point but I hope this review will serve to shed light on the holes in SQ's 5 star service and \"World's Best Airline\" reputation. I hope no one has to experience what we experienced during that disastrous layover in Singapore.",
                    "We contacted Singapore Airlines and asked if they could provide wheelchair assistance .\nAfter an excellent flight, the assistance was waiting at the gate and provided everything that was requested and even more, if Jodie ever reads this review then we hope she will accept our grateful thanks.  Singapore Airlines gave us an excellent flight throughout and we would recommend them to anyone.",
                    "Flying on Singapore Airlines used to be a total treat. Not anymore. Seats are comfy, food is OK, but the little \"extras\" that made SQ so special seems to disappear as the airline is obviously becoming cost conscious. Still better than most, but not excellent anymore.",
                    "flight was on time. star alliance members have designated line and boarded after business class. flight attendant offered to place my luggage inside overhead bin! served hot full meal with 2 options even though it was a 3 hour flight. the pork with rice was actually tasty. pillow and blanket were provided even for economy class. attentive and polite service. highly recommend.",
                    "Such attentive crew, great food, welcoming atmosphere from start to finish (shoutout to Charles Ernest!). Genuinely couldn’t have hoped for a better flight!",
                    "Shortly after a flight on Singapore Airlines I got terrible food poisoning - throwing up, gastro bloating, high fever, the works. The flight was 14 hours, and I didn't eat anything after it, so given the nature of food poisoning, it was obviously due to the awful looking slop they provided on the plane. I should have stuck to my instincts and gone hungry.\n\nAlso, the crew were disinterested, unhelpful, and mostly hiding somewhere.",
                    "The service was excellent. Very impressed to see Singapore Airlines continuing to be one of my favourite airlines to travel with. The meals were excellent, inflight entertainment was excellent, and the cleanliness in the washrooms were perfect on both of my flights. It is always wonderful travelling with Singapore Airlines and will always continue to use the airline for future travels! Way to go Singapore Airlines!",
                    "First time flying with Singapore Airlines on my way to Sydney, Australia. The service, the crew, the seat comfort, the entertainment, cabin appearance an cleanliness - all great. One thing that bothered me - my flight departed Singapore at 01:30AM local time en route to Sydney. After about 2 hours after take off, I wondered if any food service was going to happen. I walked to the galley and asked one of the crew and was told that they do not serve any food on the Sydney flight after take off, and the ONLY service (on a 9 hour flight) would be before landing. I thought that wasn't quite acceptable. Many, many passengers, including myself, had been travelling for a very long time and some food would've been good.",
                    "Paid a lot of money for this class of travel and am very underwhelmed. The support is short, ended at my lower calf and was very uncomfortable. I do wonder about the potential to cause pressure injury.\nMy husband I ended up not using them. \n\nWill not spend this sort of money again for very little comfort",
                    "Beds -my torso was not in line with my legs so turning on side meant you were sleeping in a zigzag position and when on the other side you could not bend your knees. This is a design fault and needs to be corrected. This is not good for anybody who has any back issues.\nLoading -no flight call in lounge at Singapore that's okay but when arrival at gate on appointed time about 20 business passengers were left waiting whilst premium economy was loaded first and seats from 47 upwards economy were also loaded. All before business class. Smooth and early loading is one of the reasons I chose business class.\nSuggest Etihad airlines Thai airlines or even flatbed AirAsia.",
                    "On a 13.5 hour flight we were only fed twice: breakfast at take off and supper before landing! No snacks brought round except water! The food was nice when it did come. Otherwise lovely staff; pretty standard cabin leg space, film choices etc. Singapore airport is very pricey! Most expensive pack of mints ever bought from WHSmiths!",
                    "From the Check in to the gate to the Staff on the plane everything was superb. Service absolutely top notch. Thankyou to the airline.",
                    "had noted over the years that Singapore Airlines were consistently voted the best airline in the world and after this return flight in business class i can see why.\nCheck in was efficient, courtesy of my business class ticket  i was given access to the 1903 lounge which was pretty good, unfortunately quite along walk to the gate, but once aboard all was excellent.\nthe cabin staff were all great, all speaking my name each time we interacted which is a neat trick, seat was great although i didnt have it laid to a flat bed either way, free wifi was excellent and of course the food and service were truly the best i have ever experienced on an airplane, i'd have been happy to pay for that in a restaurant\ni will always look to see if i can fly with them in the future",
                    "A decent airline with some room for improvement. I've had the opportunity to fly with Singapore Airlines a few times this year and each time I come away with different feelings. The consistency in service that you find on other airlines doesn't seem to exist with Singapore Airlines. Sometimes it's great, sometimes not so much. On this particular flight from Singapore to Dubai, boarding was late by about 40 minutes - not a huge deal but the lack of communication was frustrating. Boarding was relatively quick and the Airbus A350-900 is a fantastic aircraft to fly on. The seat was comfortable (economy) and there were nice amenities for use during the flight, such as a pillow, blanket and headphones. I opted to use my own noise cancelling head-phones connected to the In-Flight entertainment via a cable. As the aircraft pushed back, a flight attendant quite rudely told me \"noise cancelling headphones aren't allowed!\" Before I had the chance to ask why, she had already disappeared. When she passed again, I asked her about her prior instruction and she told me that I could not wear them during the safety video. At this time she realized that they were in-fact connected to the IFE and said that I could keep them on. \n\nThe first meal-service didn't start until almost 3 hours into the flight! For those, like myself, who had connected through Singapore from a previous long-haul flight, it was frustrating having to wait this long as I wanted to maximize rest for the arrival into Dubai. The second meal-service was a slice of over-cooked pizza in a soggy cardboard box. Disappointing to say the least. \n\nAll-in-all, Singapore is generally a reliable carrier with modern aircraft and nice cabins. Perhaps with some work on consistency would go along way. I'm booked to fly with them again in 2024 so it'll be interesting to see if there is some improvement here.",
                    "Flight delayed 3 hrs , consequently missed connection, no tea or coffee   available meals were attrocious",
                    "Flight on 22 April - Definitely downgraded since COVID. You used to get a flight pack, hot towel and an offer of a drink even before you left the ground, now ZILCH. There are much fewer flight attendants. They were practically running to try and get everyone their meals. You had no chance to ask for any other drinks as they were just too busy. There are no beauty items in the lavatories anymore. You used to be able to go and freshen up before landing but there was nothing. The lights were kept so dark I couldn’t work out how to open the lavatory door at first, which seems silly, but it really was quite black.\nFlight on 23 April - We then changed to SQ432 for a flight to Male, Maldives. Two stewardesses and one food cart for the whole economy section. We left at 10:05 and got our meals at 13:30. By the time the stewardesses got to our row their hands were shaking as they had to try and get people to choose the fish option as they ran out of the chicken option by the row behind us. Once again there was no chance to ask for a drink as the stewardesses were just too busy. One lot of parents let their child run down the walkway several times which we didn’t think should have been allowed for several reasons, one of them of course is safety. \nThe space for each seat has definitely grown smaller. You don’t have enough room to reach down in front of you really, unless you’re lucky enough to be on the aisle. \nWe used to find this airline terrific. We will be able to compare later in the year when we travel Air Canada and Lufthansa. We will let you know.",
                    "the steward served my daughter’s child meal (overcooked pasta penne with fancy ketchup) that is piping hot, so i have to open its lid up a little to cool it off. because of how long my kid waited, she feel asleep. i fought hard to keep it with me as multiple stewards wanted to dish it off, and 5-6 times i always have to explain and repeat my explanation.\n\nthen right after lights off (and i understand the staff do need to rest) a steward approached me as she needed to dish it out saying it is “unsanitary”,  i told her its cold but uneaten and my 2-year old will go hungry. she didnt listen and insisted on the discriminatory policy. she said there are “snacks” but didnt offer any meal to replace it. i slamed the tray out of disgust and frustration. what disappointments me is the 5-6 times they tried to dish out, if that\npolicy existed they should have communicated it so we could make a decision to wake up our kid as opposed to be victimized by economy class discrimination and that she will go hungry.\n\n12+hours flight and my daughter had a few spoons of scrambled eggs from the breakfast meal they served hours later. they do not care about families in economy class. \n\npretty dresses, pretty faces, they speak nice with a calm voice, does not necessarily mean they are good to you. but the discrimination is very awful",
                    "Singapore airlines was a comfortable flight. Everything went smoothly with no hiccups. Plane food was now more covid safe and pre-packed.",
                    "Efficient, on time, top of the line aircrafts, great seat amenities, friendly staff. Definitely one of the better airlines to fly on. Fares can be a bit high though still worth it.",
                    "The flight was reasonable, the flatbed was very hard and not comfortable to lay on, it was better to sit in a more upright position. The crew was nice and that seems to be the norm on Singapore Airline flights.\n\nThe food was pre-selected (noodles) for both of us, but not nice at all, noodles were hard and tasteless. We could not eat it.\n\nA wheelchair was available in Sydney\n\nOut of the 4 flights, this was the worst, unfortunately.",
                    "Rude of indifferent ground staff. Use really dirty lounges for long haul flights. Their Singapore located lounges are horrendously over crowded. Not an airline to use for business",
                    "For an airline supposedly No 1  I have to say my wife and I expected more. Cramped leg room , 2 meals for a 12.5 hr flight , the first within an hour of takeoff and no drinks trolleys. We were given 2 beakers of water/juice for this long haul flight. Only after seeing a person on the seat in front having a beer I enquired if alcohol was available. I was told it was but you have to ask for it. The flight costed nearly £2000 for the pair of us and it appears we have been spoilt by Emirates in the past. Maybe other classes have a better experience than ours .If you want best value this Airline is not the one for you I'm sorry to say.",
                    "Come on ! Singapore Airlines the Buisiness lounge is total joke ! M\nIf this is 1st impression you offer of your Buisiness class then it’s sad sad 😢 \n\nReally guys give us a lounge in keeping with the rest of your services ",
                    "Continually Singapore airlines are rated world best ! Amazing trip from start to finish truly professional \nCheck in Melbourne airport flawless ,the use of the lounge excellent plenty of food and drink available and very comfortable 👍\nThe Plane A350 great seats lye down plenty of room ,the onboard service was 100% efficient and very warm in discussions ( nothing was a trouble )\nAnd to finish trip luggage was out very quickly \nIn all brilliant experience highly recomend \nMichael Sutcliffe ",
                    "What a terrific airline.  always on time, they give you 30kilo's luggage allowance just by booking a flight, on board entertainment with movies are great, food is ok, staff very professional and helpful.\nCheck in is quite easy.\nThere are a couple of negatives:\nLike all airlines the legroom is not good at all, the seats are not totally comfortable but they do supply a blanket, pillow and earphones all of which you have to pay extra with Jetstar.\nI was also disappointed even though I believe I booked my flight quite early, the exit row seats had all been booked only to find on each flight old couples, small people or exceptionally obese people sitting in those aisles.\nI asked staff if it still the case the exit row seats are for customers who can in the event of an emergency to get the door open and they confirmed it is still the policy.\nWell I am glad we didn't have an accident.  These people in no way could assist and in fact would need assistance.",
                    "In July I flew, with my husband and two friends, from Auckland to Singapore, then Singapore to Johannesburg in premium economy on a Singapore airlines flight.  Having, in June, flown premium economy on Air New Zealand, I was very disappointed in these flights.  The staff were pleasant.  The food was the same food served to economy passengers.  No tea or coffee services was offered after the meals had been served.  No little premium economy packet offered.  Our friends were told there was a toothbrush in the toilet they could use.  Just not up to the standards of Air New Zealand.  The return flight in August from Johannesburg to Singapore was the same.   We then had an Air New Zealand plane from Singapore to Auckland.  What an amazing difference.  ",
                    "Took a short 2 hour flight from Singapore to Phuket with our son.  Singapore Airlines has one of the best and accommodating flights for infants with very understanding flight crews and inflight amenities.\n\nThe surprise of the flight was a well design recyclable food box containing a fantastically prepped fried rice.  Full of flavor, not so oily and just nicely tucked in a small easy to consume box. \n\nHave never been disappointed by the service and quality of the SQ flights.",
                    "Lying in bed listening to a thunderstorm in Langkawi my mind wandered back to how disappointed I was with my first Singapore Airlines flight. We travel to S E Asia a fair bit but usually SA is too expensive. I'll take a cheap flight and pay more for bulkhead seats, etc. This time I didn't bother because of all the gushing about SQ A350 plane.\n\nWell more fool me. The seat was a shocker. Thin back and actual seat padding. I'm about 5 foot ten and I swear my knees were jammed up against the seat in front.\n\nThe food was rubbish and when food service was over, the woman in front reclined into me; I couldn't move, so I reclined and the woman behind me screamed at me. So thanks SA, my first mid air skirmish in 55 years of flying. \n\nThe flight was only saved by top notch cabin crew service and the fact that we had a spare seat in our row. Never A350 again.",
                    "Staff regularly checked in on my mom, and for her, it didn't  feel like 17 hours at all. On SQ47 flight on Sep 4th, my mom was taken care of by Viona, Alvin, Grace, Albert, Philip Artha, and Cecilia. I am really appreciative of the wonderful service and peace of mind the staff gave me, knowing that my mom is well taken care of. They are the finest representation of SAs reputation. Also a very covid safe experience as they handed out sanitation kits at the start of the flight.",
                    "First time flown with singapore airlines  to Australia  can honesty say I will definitely use them again staff very helpful and just lovely on all flights singapore airport was thr best airport ever stepped in the whole experience was great ",
                    "What the hell happened to Singapore Airlines!? Used to be superb and I happily paid a premium over other airlines expecting a comfortable and enjoyable experience. \n\nEconomy flight from Singapore to Melbourne was absolute torture. Incredibly cramped cabin, genuinely felt much worse than a Ryanair type configuration... simply not suitable for an 8 hour flight. Food was atrocious, completely inedible. Absolutely stunned they are charging top prices for this rubbish. Took a couple of budget Jetstar internal flights whilst in Australia and they put Singapore to shame.\n\nI  had actually upgraded the long first leg, Manchester to Singapore to business class...food and service was top class for this and I actually found the seat pretty comfortable for sitting...but as you will read elsewhere, the bizarre angle of the footwell makes achieving a comfortable sleeping position nigh on impossible. If you're going to splash out you might aswell use Emirates or Qatar and get similar service but with a more practical bed.\n\nTruly disappointing overall, cancelled my return flights and travelled back with Qatar. Never again SIA I'm afraid.",
                    "I had originally booked on an A380 which offers their FULL business class product, and was downgraded to a REGIONAL A350 product which is usually used for their shorter (2-4 hour ish) routes. This is not acceptable for an 8 hour flight. What annoys me most is that I wasn't even told about it and thus wasn't even offered the chance to rebook. The cabin crew were great, but I didn't get what they paid for - after countless emails and escalations, I still can't find anyone who cares.",
                    "Food is always delayed. Breakfast will be served as brunch, and dinner will be served in early morning. Not a good experience for Senior citizens and children",
                    "On my flight from Delhi to Singapore ..check in and flight where ok but then it stopped unprofessional in-flight service which I give a 2 out of  10 ...with a rude Stewardess. Despite pre oder a special meal I was told there isn't any left and I had to order online... Compare to pre covid it was  overall very disappointing and poor and I would say below any standard of a cheap budget airline...on my second flight from Singapore to Sydney the food and service wasn't any better it was actually disgusting . I complained about it to Singapore airlines which was a waste of time",
                    "I recently traveled with Singapore Airlines on a trip from JFK to Bali, Indonesia in March 2023, reservation number 4DRFLW. As an avid traveler, I feel compelled to share my experience in order to provide an accurate account of my time with the airline.\n\nTo begin with, I opted for a coach class ticket, which turned out to be a regrettable decision. The seating arrangement in coach was extremely cramped, leaving very little legroom. The close proximity of the seats made it challenging to read or move comfortably, especially when the person in front reclined their seat. This often resulted in an uncomfortable experience, with their seatback practically on top of my knees, and I am only 5' in height. Even a simple trip to the bathroom became a cumbersome task, as I had to rely on holding onto the seats in front of me for support.\n\nDuring our layover in Germany, my travel companion and I decided to upgrade to business class, which offered a considerable improvement in comfort and space. However, upon our return journey, we requested an upgrade to business class for the Singapore to Germany leg, but we were informed that we could only upgrade for the entire itinerary. This policy seemed inconsistent, as we were allowed to upgrade on our way to Bali. The lack of flexibility in this matter left us puzzled and dissatisfied.\n\nFurthermore, I must express my disappointment with the attitude and behavior of the staff at Singapore Airlines. Throughout my interactions with them, I found them to be rude and unhelpful, which was surprising considering the airline's reputation. Curiosity led me to inquire about the experiences of my Asian friends who had traveled with Singapore Airlines in the past, and to my surprise, they echoed similar sentiments, sharing that they preferred non-Asian airlines due to concerns about service quality and aircraft standards. This realization only deepened my disappointment.\n\nIn addition, I found the process of dealing with Singapore Airlines' customer service to be daunting. Their staff appeared unable to think creatively or go beyond established protocols, which left me questioning their effectiveness and ability to address customer concerns.\n\nIt is important to note that my experience with Singapore Airlines encompasses merely the tip of the iceberg. While I understand that every airline can have its flaws, it is disheartening to encounter such issues with an airline of Singapore Airlines' reputation.\n\nBased on my experience, I would advise fellow travelers to consider investing a bit more to ensure a better flying experience. While Singapore Airlines may have its merits, my encounter leaves me hesitant to recommend them wholeheartedly.",
                    "Singapore airlines has very clean planes. Service is impeccable.Host and Hostess are very friendly and service oriented. Only problem I felt was landing of the plane in Siem Reap. Plane landed with a big thud. I don’t know if it was pilot’s fault or the runway at Siem Reap Airport has issues.",
                    "We always fly premium economy to Singapore and usually the staff and food are amazing. On this occasion, we felt disappointed.  The seats were great, but the staff were unfriendly and looked like they did not want to be there.  We did Book the Cook and the food was lacking.  When we asked why we didn’t get a dessert but the seats behind did, we were told it was because we had a ‘special meal’.  We received no juice on arrival and no hot towels and this was because of COVID. I think using Covid as an excuse still is wearing thin. I had to ask for water on 3 occasions and they forgot to give us coffee after the meal.  The seats are not cheap, therefore they should provide an adequate and appropriate service.",
                    "Minimal food offered never been hungry on an aircraft before. This was the Auckland to Singapore and Singapore London legs. Ran out of beer and red wine for meal. Very disappointing experience.\nStaff excellent is all I can say.",
                    "We travelled with Singapore Airlines from Europe to NZ for Christmas. It has been four years since we last travelled with them. The staff, as always, were excellent. However, the food was not good at all and has taken a notable decline in quality. We were in economy, and we can’t expect the 5 star food that is served at the front of the plane but the economy food, on all four flights was poor. The highlight were the pot noodles…\n\nThis is important when travelling with children, that they have something tasty to eat to see then through the long flights. Our kids didn’t eat any of the meals they received and they aren’t fussy eaters. There was no fruit or entree offered. \n\nWe were disappointed with this aspect of the flights. Hopefully Singapore can get back to the standard they used to have with their economy food, as they have always been our first choice for our flights to NZ.",
                    "Have flown many times with Singapore Airlines over the last 14 years and have been extremely happy but not anymore. Flew Brisbane to Ho chi min then Singapore back to Brisbane May 2022. Seats extremely uncomfortable and so jammed in that I was unable to recline my seat at 2am on overnight flight as my seat was resting on the passenger behind. Food was so bad couldn't eat it. Only offered a drink at dinner time .\nNo breakfast was served , not even a glass of water prior to landing at 7am . No hot towels and no amenities packs.\nMight as well flown with a budget airline !!!!\nProbably will not fly Singapore airlines again unless they improve their service !!!!!",
                    "How this airline wins any awards for ANY aspect of its service is beyond me. Flights delayed, bags lost, completely incompetent customer service. I can track my pizza delivery down to the last km, but Singapore Airlines cannot tract a bag, if you have a choice, don’t book this airline. Emirates are so far ahead of these guys in every single aspect, it’s hard to believe how they survive. Nice friendly cabin crew, that’s where it ends. Let’s see if our bags turn up today ??",
                    "Pre flight experience is a total mess. Lounges are crowded, dirty tables and empty food containers. It almost felt like I had come to free buffet and riots could break out at any tine. If you expect premium pre flight experience Singapore airlines has totally lost it. \n\nSame applied to pre boarding experience (maybe my exp is limited to flights to India) \nThe staff is rude and ill manners and security and boarding is like herding cattle in a barn. The holding area is cramped with barely 1 seat for 3 passengers.\n\nI had heard a lot about SIngapore airlines and the experience. This is definitely closer to the worst performing airlines and not best.\nOn-board product was great no issues with that",
                    "Although flying with Singapore Airlines is comfortable and convenient, we would like to mention that their staff are what makes them exceptional. \nWe had a difficult situation and they handled it with patience, kindness and effectiveness. They didn't stop until they found a solution. We want to thank to the staff in general but very much in particular to Thuong and Hang, from the ground staff (Hanoi). Thank you very much! We will definitely use Singapore service whenever possible in the future. You got two new loyal customers!",
                    "This was our first time flying on Singapore Airlines.  I can understand why they are consistently called the best airline in the world.  We traveled in coach.  The seat was comfortable and had enough legroom and I am tall.  The food served in coach was quite good.  You can actually choose your entree a day or two before your flight.  Everything was a good experience.  We would definitely fly with them again.",
                    "Flights from Manchester to Bangkok via Singapore were excellent. My luggage did not arrive which caused stress and anxiety and the cost of purchasing essential items.\nContacting Singapore Airlines to obtain, maybe, an apology and reimbursement is a nightmare. I have emailed customer service several times without success. \nThe condition of the business class section on the return flight Bangkok to Singapore was unbelievably dirty. \nOverall I feel disappointed with my experience.",
                    "The trouble with being voted the best is that the only way is down. Such seems to be happening to Singapore Airlines. \n\nLet’s begin with the aircraft. It was an A380. It must have been one of the older ones in the fleet. My seat in premium economy was extremely uncomfortable. It seemed to be worn so the padding had become flattened. I had to sit on a cushion to achieve any kind of comfort on the almost 10 hour flight. Even then, my bottom hurt for a day or so afterwards.\n\nNext, the food offering. Bland, tasteless and overall boring just about sums it up. My wife is gluten intolerant and she was offered virtually the same menu for both meals. Disappointing.\n\nFinally, the service. It seemed to me that the crew were anxious to get home to Singapore. They didn’t seem too interested in the passenger client at all. My wife asked three times for some water…..it never arrived. Service was inconsistent throughout the cabin as I saw one side paid a lot more attention than the other.\n\nOn the plus side (there are not many), the flight was on time. \n\nWe are on our return leg to the UK next week. I hope they can do better.",
                    "I paid an overinflated £1299 for an economy return to Singapore. Singapore Airlines is currently monopolising the market and overcharging customers brutally. \n\nServices were abysmal from stepping into the plane. Had to ask for BLANKETS  and PILLOWS for a long haul flight. Commencing the 12.5 hours journey, we were offered 1 meal within the first hour after take off then absolutely nothing, not even a beverage for the next 9 hours. Despite being a day flight, they switched off the cabin lights 3 hours after departure trying to get everyone to sleep so they don't have to work. I went to the galley to ask for food and was only offered a fun pack size chips and a glass of coke with ice, not the 330ml can. Never felt so dehydrated boarding a flight. We were then served a small breakfast meal just before landing. Only positive is the inflight entertainment with a wide selection of Western movies.\n\nThis is the worse Singapore Airlines flight I have been on with all the cost cutting measures yet overinflated flights. They do not deserve the 5 star skytrax rating. It feels more like a budget low cost airline. Absolute shambles.",

Snacks rounds were not done for covid safety, but snacks n drinks were kept at service area for self service.\nToilet was very very clean, and was cleaned after every single use.\n\nSFO-SIN: empty airport, lounge closed, so given 25 USD/person to buy food drink at a Japanese restaurant near boarding gate. Only 6 passengers in the whole aircraft. Again served 2 hot meals and plenty of snacks offered. Before landing, crew in charge, mr Victor Lim offered a bag full of snacks water to take to our quarantine hotel.\n\nSIA is very reliable and provides BEST service even during the tough pandemic period.\nWell done SIA",
                    "After a pleasant stay at the Silver Kris lounge in Brisbane it was time to board the Singapore Airlines A350-900 in their regional medium haul configuration. \n\nThe service from the crew throughout the flight was great and attentive and nothing was too much trouble. I had ordered their book the cook for dinner from the menu available online and it was delicious but I was also expecting breakfast and they seemed a little surprised when I asked about it as they served other passengers. \n\nSeems on the 7-8 flight between Brisbane and Singapore you get a choice of dinner as soon as possible after take-off or breakfast shortly before landing which I wasn’t aware of but they did serve me a delicious breakfast when I asked about it.\n\nThe champagne and cocktails served in business class were really nice as was the small amenity kit you could ask for which came in a nice zippered pouch which came in useful after the flight on my trip.\n\nThe main issue I had was the seat itself I constantly kept bumping into the touch seat controls moving the seat and turning on and off the lights and TV screen which became annoying after a while, also I found the wing on the seat really made it hard to get a good view out of the window. The seat seemed to have plenty of storage but just wasn’t as comfortable for me as some other seats I have been lucky enough to fly in over the years.\n\nOverall a pleasant enough flight which was on time.\n",
                    "On Summer holiday, I went on a trip form Hong Kong to Singapore on an A220 , the seats are not that great but the staff is extremely friendly and helpful also the in-flight entertainment has a lot of choices, overall the flight itself is pretty good and I would definitely recommend it.",
                    "Over rated and under performed.  \nGood:  Cleanliness.  Check in.  Entertainment.  Flight attendants.  \nAverage: seats.  Food taste.  Poor: the flight from JFK to Frankfurt.  No water or services in between meals.  \nVery poor: Food quantity.  Seat space with fully reclined front passenger.  Boarding and disembarkment process.    \nUnacceptable: JFK disembarkment process took 1 hour of seating on the runway.   JFK lugguage handling took 2 and a half hour caused misconnections.  \n\nDon't fly on Singapore Airlines A380 aircraft economy class.   With so many people and with low priority toward economy class, you feel you are not welcome from food quantity, embarkation and disembarkment, and lugguage handling.  Singapore Airlines class focus services are sacrificing the economy class travelers and making their trip experiences worst than other airlines on a smaller plane.  My family paid 150% more for the same trip than flying competing airlines based on the Singapore Airlines unearned reputation and we were disappointed.",
                    "Great value. When premium economy was cheaper then economy I had to jump on the chance. The crew were fantastic and super professional. The onboard hard product was just amazing comparatively to its competitors. And the soft product for such a short flight was quite fantastic especially during covid times. 10/10 would recommend to anyone who is thinking about taking this airline.",
                    "12 months on and there’s still only one flight from Manchester , can’t believe it!!  And this is twice the price as Heathrow withe a choice of 4 flights.  Wow I’ve talked to other people in the north who also find it a big Chor to travel 2/300 miles to get the flight they want    Come on staff WAKE UP CALL !!",
                    "Singapore generally is the best for me and amongst the things I enjoy is being able to have a shower in the lounge after a full day at work. I was told the showers had recently broken and when I looked the sig said 23rd May, so over a month on 25th May (even the notive looks tired and bedragled). Whe I said I did not think this was recent the loune staff at the entrance laughed (not a great way to make a customer feel valued). The food offering is also a little limited compared to say United's lounge in April. Overall the lounge experience was about 1. The flight on the other had was good, although food service is not as swift in these Covid times, but that is what it is and hard to balme the inflight service team for this. Book the cook is one of the true joys of flying SIA. The new Lounge is gradually getting there, but in both early Jan and again today there is no articial sweetner, obviously us diabetics are supposed to just grin and bear it. Of the last 5 times I have used the lounge, Nov and Dec last year and April and may this year (in the old and newer configs, I have been able to have artifical sweetner in my coffee once. I do love my coffee and this annoys me greatly. Maybe when they have the lounge ful open and it does not become a bare pit towards midnight they will also get the supplies sorted.",
                    "I’ve booked a Premium Economy flight from Dubai to Singapore but later it turned out there is no dedicated Premium Economy section on the plane. When I logged a complaint, Singapore Air offered to cancel my booking free of charge, so that I can book it again. The problem is that at the time of this offer the tickets have become more expensive than when I booked my “fake” Premium Economy class. I rejected this “generous” offer and asked for a refund, the difference between the Premium Economy and Economy. Since then radio silence. A low budget airline customer support is better than this, to be honest. Never ever Singapore Air, Emirates it’s much better and more honest.",
                    "I had travel to Bangkok in December 2021. I was very impressed with cabin crew. They all were very nice and professional. Flight was on time and food also fantastic !!!",
                    "This review is for a return journey.  We flew the Brisbane Singapore route on the A350 900 regional aircraft and the A380 on the Singapore London route.  The regional aircraft is very comfortable in both sitting and lying.  We were not as comfortable in the A380.  Sitting up straight and lying down was okay but lounging was very uncomfortable with a seam in the seat that ground into one's coccyx. We had window seats mostly and they  felt very private.  The staff were exceptional as always on all flights and the bathrooms were kept clean and tidy.  The choice of food was best from Book the Cook and there was an excellent wine choice.  Speciality coffees are welcome.  We unfortunately heard criticism from other passengers when we were delayed boarding on one flight.  I do think we need to be more generous and understand the world is still getting back on its feet since COVID-19.  Thank you Singapore Airlines.  You made our trip memorable and nothing was too much trouble.",
                    "Vietnam to Singapore we were provided with a decent tasting meal and consistently good service.\n\nSingapore to Manchester an entirely different experience. \n\nAwful food and not a great service. \n\nAll I can say is don't chose the Carrot Cake Option. Nothing to do with what it sounds like! It smelt herendous & consisted of Prawns amongst other things.\n\nSame with the Snacktime Bun we were given. It smelt vile & tasted of fermented fish in the middle. I felt like throwing up. \n\nThe Scrambled Egg / Spinach option wasn't edible.  I called for a flight attendant to ask for an alternative. After explaining the food was inedible, I was asked what was wrong with it as everyone was eating it without complaint! \n\nThe last thing I wanted  or expected was attitude from the air stewardess!",
                    "I flew with Singapore Air for the first time not long before covid and was impressed by everything, seat comfort, food, movies and service. My last flight was a total disappointment. Not many movies and the food was disgusting, it was a code share flight and I couldn't even get lounge access on a 5 hour layover. Won't be in a hurry to fly again with them.",
                    "Travelled from Man to BKK via Singapore and return. Outbound flight was on an Airbus 590 with the skewed sleeping arrangement which I found to be most uncomfortable. Although the seat was wide it lacked support for the lower back and I thought that the TV screen was much too close to the seat. The flight from Singapore to BKK on the B787 was little better as the seat was very narrow and the partition dividing the seats made it feel very claustrophobic. Again, I found there to be a lack of lower back support. This time the TV screen was further away. The return flights were very similar.\nHowever, where Singapore airlines does score highly is in the way that the cabin crew look after the passengers; service was superb and nothing was too much trouble. Food also was so much better than any other airline we have travelled on, especially the Book The Cook option. Also, the lounges, with the exception of the one in Manchester, were first class with an excellent choice of food available. Despite my criticism of the seats I would definitely fly Singapore again.",
                    "Again we are amazed what this airline is doing - after many,many flights with SGX both for business and private we had to fight to get seats not separated between parents and 10 and 12 yo kids - in the end they “managed” to get seats without 10 and 12yo not sitting by themselves after us telling them that we will\nmake them sign a waiver that we will not be able to be responsible as guardians for what happens to our kids or what they will be doing. All because they want $$$ to get you to pay for seat allocation. Sad to see what has become of a once grand airline.",
                    "Great customer service from Singapore Airlines from Melbourne to Singapore, then Singapore to Sri Lanka. The prices of the ticket were much more affordable compared to the direct flight option, and Changi airport does not disappoint during a layover. The only thing I would wish for was a footrest which would’ve made travelling economy a bit more comfortable, but we were spoiled with a comfy pillow and blanket!\nThe airhostesses were very friendly, one of them even pointed out a free aisle to me so I can sleep properly! \nWe felt so full from all the food we were fed and overall, felt very welcome by the staff on our flights with Singapore Airlines.\nI lost the paper with the specific names of airhostesses but still would recommend using SA for travels.",
                    "From the moment we got to the check-in gate to the farewell wishes on disembarkation it felt like we had travelled back in time to the golden days of air travel – this is what it was all about.\n\nTruly friendly staff on the ground and in the air, a perfectly clean, spacious and tidy cabin all made for a flight that was most enjoyable from start to finish. I will definitely spend a few dollars more to fly AQ in the future.",
                    "Flight SQ286 first class Auckland to Singapore on 05.01.2024 suite 1A and 2A . Was amazing all through the flight. A big thank you to the cabin crew. They made us feel very special and amazing service and food. The crew was a credit to your airline.\nFlight SQ285 first class from Singapore on 19.01.2024. suite 1A and 2A\nWe could not fault the reception through Changi airport starting from the First class reception and check in to the lounges. Unfortunately this changed after we boarded the flight. The inflight service was below par. The inflight crew presented as flustered, disorganised and appeared not to be working as a team. This was completely different from SQ286. Meals were served sporadically, meals being disorganised with very little enthusiasm, it was like the staff were just going through the motions to get it out of the way. This was very clear during the second meal which we pre ordered a main as it was Lunch, The cabin crew were very difficult to understand due to the quiet tone through out the flight. We were given breakfast with choices of cereal, fruit and breads followed very quickly with a main pre ordered meal of steak and my wife had burger, this was very strange and not appetizing it could not be eaten.\nThe climate control on the flight during sleep period was extremely hot. During this period no cabin crew were within the vicinity to ask about this.\nIt appeared that the First Class cabin crew were not as professional as the crew on  our flight SQ286.\nVery disappointing return flight as this was a special occasion for my wife and I.\nAlso the advert for First class had a teddy on each bed which our grandchildren were excited about having unfortunately on both flights this was not the case and were advised  they had ran out. again another disappointment .\nUnsure if we would pay the $20.000 NZD plus again if this is the standard of service provided.",
                    "I paid extra to get the forward seating section in economy just after premium economy. \nThere was an empty row behind me and I was about to put my seat down as the seat in front of me put hers down so making my face pretty close to her head rest.\nWhen I was lowering the back of my seat suddenly I felt someone pushing back at me . I looked back and there were 2 passengers from the regular economy section occupying the empty row behind me that were not their assigned seats.\nI have no problems people switching seats but are they supposed to cause problems for passengers in their assigned seats trying to sleep on red eye flights? \nThe unfriendly passenger insisted on pushing back at my seat every chance she gets making my 18 hour long haul back home super uncomfortable . For this I took away a point from Singapore airlines that has been my to go airline whenever I go to Singapore . I have travel in both Business and Premium economy before and this is first time trying their economy in the “forward” section having paying extra .",
                    "I booked business class. The seats were dirty and when I opened up my tray table, it had food scrapes on it. \nThe food choice offered were very limited. They did not cater for different dietry restrictions . I am a vegetarian and they didn't have any vegetarian appetizers. My only regret is that I forgot to take pictures of this horrible experience",
                    "Honestly don’t even know where to begin because we experience many type of discrimination and Mediocre service through out. Let’s start with skin color, as long you are white they don’t have any issue and let you be any other color they will treat you like they are paying for your travel! Me and my husband keep getting stopped and checked and passport held at the gate with no reason giving and always the last getting serviced on the plane. The flight attendant will keep tapping on our shoulders waking us up from sleeping for nothing!! And when we ask for service they are no where to be found. Definitely felt the side eye from them! Definitely the least fav airline won’t choose them and definitely do not recommend!",
                    "For this flight, the experience of clearing immigration and customs at New Delhi Airport was one of chaos and delays.  So finally being able to board this flight in business class was a massive relief.  It was very pleasant to be greeted by the crew by name, shown to the spacious 2017 business class seat (following a late decision to upgrade), and finally relaxing in the new environment.  I took full advantage of the amenities, enjoying a glass of champagne (lovely) after take off, followed by a Singapore Sling (a little too sweet for my taste) and trying the Krisflyer Sling (much nicer than the former).  I had also 'booked-the-cook' for my meal but have to say that the lobster thermidor (served as brunch), while still tasty, was not as enjoyable as previous iterations.  It was a relatively smooth flight except for the turbulence we  experienced over a portion of the Indian Ocean (apparently, a common occurrence).  The in-flight experience on Singapore Airlines is one of the best in the business and I had no problems finding one or two movies that piqued my interest.  The graphics on the flight navigation display were excellent - I would agree with previous reviewers who suggested that having several external cameras would have been fantastic.  I also tried the seat in lie-flat mode, and found that without bedding, it was a little uncomfortable so chose to sit mostly in a semi-recumbent position.  Overall, a very good journey!",
                    "We had been looking forward with much anticipation to flying with Singapore as we usually fly Qantas which has had so many bad raps lately. We flew to Bangkok with Qantas and back via Singapore from Singapore. However in our economy flying  experience, Qantas wins hands down for food and service.  \nThe food was to put it mildly abysmal. Breakfast consisted of a small sweet muffin, a dry bun with a pat of butter and jam and a pot of yogurt - not a protein in sight. My lunch was tasteless fish with overcooked broccoli and peas if some sort of sauce.  We have had better food offered on an hours flight with Bangkok Air.\nUnlike Qantas there was no offer of a pre-meal drink and nibble and in fact very little choice - red or white wine and no spirits. \nOn the plus side, the entertainment was good and the steward were very polite and willing and the toilets kept clean  and regularly sanitised.",
                    "My flight experience was made so much more enjoyable by Christine Seah and her team on the SYD-SIN flight. They were professional, friendly and keep us well fed.\n\nThe flight left an hour late and arrived in Singapore just as my other flight was boarding.  Of course, it had to be the furthest boarding gate.  We ran, took 2 trains and made it puffing out of breath. On reflection, there were 7 passengers trying to make the same connection and it would been courteous to round us up and put us on an airport mover, rather than individually finding our way.\n\nChristine helped us with the wifi onboard and it was quite decent speed.\n\nI loved the dessert trolley. It was not an easy decision to select one.The inflight menu of nasi lemak with chicken thigh was delicious.\n\nSleeping was a bit awkward as the design of the leg compartment is at an angle to the seat\n\nThank you to Christine, Sherine, Luqmian, Jordan, Fizah and Yuko for a very lovely flight.\n",
                    "First time flying with Singapore Airlines the flight out in economy was very good with nice service food and good setback entertainment however we were disappointed on the return flight after paying for premium economy the food was poor as was the seatbelt padding was awful and the service was below average I know it was a night flight however I was parched on landing we may use the same flight next year but would only do economy ",
                    "I travel a lot and can see why this is ranked so highly as a top airline winning numerous awards.  Service is outstanding, a lot of airlines can learn from them!  From checking in to cabin crew, excellent.  I did four flights with them and on all four flights, cabin crew were super sweet, polite, friendly and helpful.  I did notice that they had a lot more crew onboard than other airlines showing that they valued the customers.  What I also liked was even at night when people were sleeping, staff were available to see if people needed anything.  The crew did their job well.  The plane was very clean.  Meals were served quickly and they gave you enough time to eat and then cleared up really well.  The crew took pride in what they did and worked together as a team.  Nothing was ever too much for them.  Toilets were clean too!  One of the few airlines having flown a few in the pandemic that really manage social distancing.  Masks are compulsory and they try to keep the middle seat free between passengers.  They are very strict with boarding and when landing this is done in rows.  People need to wait their turn.  Other airlines do not always do this.  What is also good, if you are in transit upon arrival in Singapore, they allow the transit passengers to get off first and you will be met by ground staff depending where you have come from and when your next flight is.  They will help you if you are running short on time to get to your next flight.  This is all part of the new rules with the pandemic.  Check in and boarding is very efficient and on time.  Flights all departed on time and landed punctually or even early.  Planes were a nice temperature as they can sometimes be too cold or hot.  Seats in economy were very comfortable and spacious.  Really good selection of movies, games, music and more!  There are charging sockets too and wifi that you can pay for.  I think this is free if you are a member of their KrisFlyer Miles.  Food is really good and they have a big selection of other options if you have dietary restrictions that you can book prior to departure.  What I also like is you can check prior to your flight what choice of meal options you will get (usually a choice of 2 options), if you don't like either then choose a special meal or no meal at all.  The no meal at all is a good option if you don't plan to eat so they don't waste.  Even on a short flight, they gave a really nice light meal that some airlines don't.  Staff are very caring.  I did not want my breakfast and neither did a few other people but they kept asking us are you sure or if we wanted something else.  Very sweet.  Well organised.  Luggage came out quickly.  My only small negative is that you cannot check in online prior to departure which I am guessing is due to the pandemic and so they can check paperwork.  Having said this, I can totally understand but they should let you choose seats which I could not do.  Normally planes are really dirty at the end of a long flight but this was clean.  I would fly Singapore Airlines all the time if they were cheaper!  The other small negative is that on a long night flight, they have snacks available between meals.  They don't obviously serve it as most people are sleeping which is fine but they should let people know via an announcement before 'lights out'.  They do post it on the inflight system but not all people check this.  This has nothing to do with the airline but if you are in transit, I had one long layover and the airport is really dead at the moment.  Most things are closed with the pandemic and very few eateries or shops are opened.  I was super bored.  Wifi is generally fine but keeps disconnecting so take a book or download a movie on your phone or laptop to occupy the time.  There was a transit hotel I believe and you are free to go to the other terminals which were pretty much all the same.  Terminals 1 and 3 were the most active.  Rules change all the time and it really depends where you have come from as some countries are deemed high risk meaning if you are in transit you will go to a 'holding area' and cannot walk around the terminal.",
                    "A long haul flight Melbourne - Singapore -Rome in premium economy with pretty much no service!  We hadn’t pre booked meals and got left over economy food poorly presented!  Had to ask for a glass of poor quality wine and no seconds offered!  Flight home, Frankfurt-Singapore-Melbourne just as bad!  After take off from Singapore the lights weren’t not even turned on!  They wanted us to just go to sleep!  That flight we buzzed and asked for a drink and snacks, as did most of the cabin!    Breakfast the only meal served 5 hours into flight!\n\nBathroom was shared with economy and quite a long walk back!  No amenities kit or pre flight glass of bubbles either!",
                    "My experience at the hands of Singapore Airlines on my outbound trip was so appalling, I felt I should be fair and review the return trip.\nThe check-in and boarding were slow for the flight from Bangalore to Singapore SQ509, probably because of only one aisle on a 737. The 4 hr. trip in Economy was alright, but only 2 washrooms for 138 people plus crew?  The flight and lunch were far better than anything on the outbound flights.  The flight was a little late leaving but made up a little time for our arrival in Singapore.\nBoarding on the Singapore –Sydney flight, SQ231, was chaotic, the tannoy system was like an old British Railway Station, incomprehensible, so crowds were continually rushing to the gate thinking their seats had been called.  Once on board the A380 was the most comfortable aircraft so far.  Unfortunately, after a very quick whip round with water and juice the crew disappeared for about 5½ hrs. surfacing only to serve breakfast.  Breakfast was average, but edible.  The menu and food were nothing special and didn’t make up for the very high ticket price on this trip.\nThe $3 breakfast at the Noodle and Tava restaurant in Bangalore International Airport the day before put Singapore Airlines to shame.  Who checks what  passengers are fed?\nAs an aside, the 5 star facilities in Bangalore International Airport eclipsed those in Changi.\nMy opinion of Singapore Airlines wasn’t changed much by my return trip.  Check for  any other options before parting with my money!",
                    "Have heard great things about Singapore Airlines, so decided to give it a try. Booked a long haul flight. Even though it's almost 17 hour flight, but didn't feel like one, when my journey ended I was as fresh as when i boarded the flight.\n\nSilverkris lounge at Changi Airport was good. They have sleeping pods as well as a bathroom, where you can take a shower, in case you feel like one :) \n\nFood was amazing. They have the facility called - \"Book a Cook\", which i'd used for getting my Steak. (Attached the pic), it was so delicious and perfect as if I'm dining in a restaurant.\n\nCrew was polite and very helpful.\n\nOnly drawback that I find is - at NewYork (JFK Airport), they don't have a nice lounge. Lounges, they have partnered with were so small and didn't have a nice quick bite / snacks or drinks. Wish they can do something about it.\n\nAll in all, must admit, Singapore Airline is the best airline",
                    "We had the chance to test Singapore's Business Class in their A350, A380 and their 787. All in all a very good experience!",
                    "This was a short haul flight but still of enough time to impress us very much. From check in till disembarking it was just about as good as an economy flight can be.\n\nCheck in was smooth and professional, the plane comfotable and the entertainment system great.\n\nBest of all was the food which was better than some business class flights we've had.\n\nAll in all a great experience.",
                    "Disappointed with this flight. Thought Singapore Airlines was the gold standard. It was just ordinary. We took off on time which was great as it was a late night flight and arrived ahead of schedule. \n\nPremium economy was a small cabin (24 seats) but there was not much to suggest this class and the massive upcharge over economy. The seat recline was quite clever (A350) in that on full recline it slide so as not to encroach too much on the passenger space behind.  The noise cancelling headphones were effective and the entertainment screen was larger than in economy with a very good selection of films, music, TV etc. but there was not other amenity except a bottle of water. \n\nYou could 'book a cook' which expanded the food selection considerably (mainly Asian cuisine though) but nearing midnight, who can face a meal? There were two full service meals. We only had the second one and it was acceptable.\n\nThe cabin crew did the bare minimum and hid away for much of flight. However, when called, they responded quickly and politely. The wearing of masks did not help their cause, it was difficult to understand them and it felt like a medical flight!\n\nThe lavatories deteriorated over the length of the flight and things like paper towels etc were poorly managed.\n\nI always thought BA were poor but they aren't that bad having now flown Singapore Airlines.",
                    "I fee so bad to give such low rating to once I so loved Airline \nI first flew SA in 1985\nIt was awesome. Great service good food and friendly and smilig staff.\nFifteen hours of fliying is not great specially if you can not get your green tea. May be she forget coz the flight was full.or it is just me expecting the same service as before.\nLunch was ok dinner was not tasty and no one was as friendly like before.\nIt is very unlikely that I will fly with SA in the future.",
                    "Still my favorite airline. Best Economy Class, spacious sets with nice legroom, pleasing color fabric on seat covers. Each seat had a pillow and a blanket. You should ask to offer you an amenity kit (with socks, eye cover, toothbrush / paste). Pity they do not have inflight magazine due to covid, (same excuse to save money and weight_ a lot of airlines are using the same excuse). Both flights were on perfect A350 and on time. After takeoff they started the first service which was tasty and there was selection of wine, beer, drinks. After food was desert which was ice-cream. During flight the crew was passing by the bottle of water for the passengers. At the galley there were some sandwiches and drinks. In the WC there were toothbrushes, cologne and cream. One hour before landing the second meal was served which was as good and plentiful as the first.  IFE was great with a good selection of movies and easy to use. Great airline, keep the good work.",
                    "I travelled from Bombay to Singapore on 16th June and then returned on 27th June. The standards of the Service and food are deteriorating day by day. What I observed that they are doing their 'allotted job' nicely but if you want them to come in-between, their Service becomes poor. They do their normal job well but are in so much hurry to 'complete' it that they forget special requests( like extra quilt/pillow/hot water to drink etc). One has to remind them repeatedly. This wasn't the case earlier. I have now decided to try other alternate airlines. Even my children staying in Singapore have same opinion. I will encourage others to try them for other than routine services and give their ratings/reviews.",
                    "Not the Singapore Airlines that used to be. \nSeats were very uncomfortable. Food was very average. Luggage was lost and arrived two days later.",
                    "Although Singapore Airlines has a great reputation our experience was not particularly impressive in a good way. We flew business class. The pod was ok for sleeping but if you are tall, the angle is a bit awkward for one’s feet. I was more comfortable on Lufthansa business class and United’s Polaris. However, we starved. The food we were served was tasty but inadequate for a 19 hour flight. We were served dinner shortly after taking off and then another meal about half way through the flight but on the way over were then  given just a small package of Oreo cookies. On the way back when I woke from a nap I saw other passengers in business class eating sandwiches with some bags of chips but when I asked for a sandwich I was told there weren’t any and was offered a small bag of nuts. That was it for the 9 + hours since our mid flight meal which is really skimpy especially given what we paid for the ticket. The airline couldn’t spare another few dollars for a sandwich? Even in economy United serves a sandwich a few hours before landing on a flight that long. I will say though that they handled their baggage glitch well. Although we were practically the first customers to check into the flight at JFK because we had a layover so our bags should have made the flight, for some reason they didn’t and after waiting at baggage claim in Singapore for our bags not to appear and we went to the baggage services office. As soon as we gave our name we were told that our bags were still at JFK and given some paperwork to complete- they had already prepared most of the form-  along with some  money to buy essentials. Apparently, the airline was well aware that the luggage was left behind and was prepared. Our bags were delivered the next day to our hotel. The airline did handle the baggage issue well but I never imagined I would have had to pack a lunch for business class. Also, although we had access to the airline club as is common when flying business or first class internationally we were only allowed in 2 hours before the flight which isn’t common. I’ve never had a time limitation before and that exacerbated our hunger because we didn’t have much time to eat during the limited time we had in the club and then had to leave to walk the gate to board. Our experience wasn’t awful and it is good to have a nonstop to Singapore but I’d select another airline for another route.",
                    "Bit disappointed today. Long very cold flight (take really thick winter trousers,jacket, socks etc. a top,  jacket long skirt and trainers thin airline blanket  were not enough ) 2 meals served quality ok. Served 8hrs apart and we were very hungry after 8hrs. Lots of cold water offered but no warm drinks , had to ask, they did help with cold when we eventuallygot them. Service bizarre, a very long drawn out service of trays handed out individually to those who had booked particular meals eg. veg. When a couple of us asked if we could collect our food we had a very grumpy response \"we are serving children first\" which was untrue as one or two were served, several children weren't until after most adults had been served. A belligerent attempt to put hungry and cold ECONOMY CUSTOMERS in their place. Poor show as flight not cheap.",
                    "Best airline in the world, seats, food, service are all brilliant.  The crew are friendly and welcoming.  We love flying with Singapore Airlines",
                    "Paying thousands for this return trip I definitely expected at least for it to be on par with others. It is what they do not provide that bugged me. Cost cutting insulting to passengers.\nNo amenity kit. No PJs. No breakfast for a flight landing at 8am. No nice snacks. After a meal not long after taking off, there were only “delectables” JUNK food. Cup noodles, chips (crisps), cookies. Very  poor for a nearly 8 hr flight. So much for gold standard that they once were.  Even Jetstar business offers more food.",
                    "Apart from a bit more space Premium Economy experience was very poor.\nThe blanket came out of the sealed bag all creased and looked as if it had never been laundered and the small amenity kit came came out of a bag that looked  all crinkled as if it had been used before.The seats gave a little more room but the leg rest was pretty useless and gave no support especially if you also used the footrest which in itself was more of a hazard than a help.My seat had a patch on the armrest and the other armrest was non existent as it housed the tray table which when in use sloped to one side.\nI used book the cook for the food and was expecting something special but it was no better than \na normal economy meal and I did not eat it.It was presented just like economy but with a bread roll perched on top,the chicken was like rubber and the frittata for breakfast looked like a block of lego and was more style over substance.Because I asked for a hot chocolate I had to waite half an hour until the other meals had been served.\nIn a nutshell the seats were dirty and shabby,the food and service very poor and not worth paying extra for.I have traveled on Air France premium economy in the past and it was a much better experience.",
                    "We recently flew coach on Singapore Airlines from LAX to Tokyo’s Narita Airport. Our experience: It was great. The onboard service (talking coach here) harkened back in quality to the older days of flying: elegant, professional, attentive, super-personable flight crew; clean well-maintained cabin and toilets; comfortable seats with decent leg room; exquisite (for plane food) meals with proper utensils; good selection of films/programs on functioning devices. The time onboard passed by easily, and we arrived in Tokyo without that just-rode-in-a-cattle-car feeling.\n\nI used to fly often when I was a kid (mostly internationally, from the early 70s to the mid 80s). The golden age of flying was a faded point in history by then, but I remember how the default quality and dignity of customer service by airports and airlines still hinted at the privilege of air travel. I contrast that with my more recent experiences with air travel: zoo with wings. You want to see a third world airport? Have a look around JFK. A classy one? There are a number of them (maybe start with Istanbul), just not in the US. You want to fly on a US airline (just successfully fly point-to-point on schedule, not aspire to have a quality experience)? Roll the wheel and test your fortunes.\n\nLately, it’s gotten so unpleasant that my wife and I chose to take a cross-country train to LA to catch our flight from LAX to Japan’s Narita Airport rather than endure airport shenanigans and the snafu potential of trying to fly out of NYC to make a connecting flight. It’s as if certain companies have forgotten how to conduct a commercial transaction. Me pay for goods and services, you give me said goods and services. But our collective sacrifices will allow some poor CEO to have a hot, nutritious meal, so perhaps we can write it off as charity work.\n\nSingapore Airlines took me back to the older days of flying. Wish we could use them for everywhere we plan to go.",
                    "We flew Singapore Airlines to US of A from India . To  be precise from Chennai to San Francisco and back with flight  change  both ways at  Changi airport in Singapore.We had done some preliminary research of the other airlines too but this one had higher customer approval ratings.\n\nIn the parlance of the the new age flyers, Economy  is often known as  cattle class.Some justification may be seen in that description when one surveys the boarding time scenario. Passengers in  this class  are herded towards the boarding gate  like cattle through a checkpoint where each one is examined and scanned for carrying just one cabin baggage and a valid boarding pass .  As the herd enters the aircraft they need to fall in line and walk past the superior class section to the cramped  narrow aisle way into the economy class section where they start looking for their assigned seats. After finding it they manage to squeeze their usually overstuffed cabin baggage in an already usually overstuffed over head compartment before strapping themselves in their seat.These manoeuvres often block the progress of their fellow passengers who must wait patiently till the path is cleared. If there happens to be any irate passenger in the waiting line a scuffle could erupt if the passengers are a family and took too much time to settle down . I and my family  did block the line but  managed to keep the delay short and avoided such a possibility.\n\nThe space in front and sides of my seat , as I foresaw ,was cramped as I sat down and straitjacketed myself . I had very little space to move my limbs freely although the seats were cushioned and soft . As always the hand rest in this class had to be shared with one's neighbouring passenger who incidentally were no strangers to me. They were my own family members .  The speaker socket and the control handset were all tucked around the inner part of my seat.Without the necessity to move this way or that I managed to get access to these .Thanks to  my grand daughter ,seated on my left, who managed it for me.\n\nThe plight of an occupant of such a seat is best compared to that of a sardine stuffed in a can . A living human being  however ,is more demanding  than  dead sardines and requires space, and lots of it, for real comfort but unfortunately  today's airline economics is based on space conservation as priority. All others are secondary, although this is not spelt out in so many words.In simpler words, \"They dare not throw away space generously at the going rate of economy airfares\" - and remain flying.  Comfort, therefore is  compromised by  re-interpreting it  as minimum discomfort and that makes all the difference in defining the present day economy class . Increasing the size of the seat a  few inches more  and adding fancy devices like the  footrest and including an extra item or two in the food menu, the economy  becomes premium economy class with little or no added value at an extra cost , unless provided gratis by the airline itself, which incidentally they did for us for our return journey.  Other airlines, I believe, are no different from this airline  in this kind of space and seat management in this class.\n\nTo survive the cut throat competition  more innovative measures are necessary to keep an airline flying. Singapore Airlines have devised a path breaking  strategy in this direction admirably. They have  unleashed  a  team of  well trained flight crew inside the cabin . This unique team of select male and female members slim and trim in build and nimble in negotiating through the narrow aisle and row space and a polite to a fault and soft speaking voice often bend over backwards to please the passengers  to make them feel at home and wanted in their aircraft. Over and above this first step  they have  added a choice menu of delicious  sounding airline food and a huge range of flight entertainment material that can keep you awake on long haul flights ,that is , if you cannot manage your sleep  in the cramped position .  Hey presto ! They  have broken some barrier and soon started flying far higher than their rivals with sky high reviews to boot.\n\nBeing a heavy set man, my own estimate of minimum discomfort level  was far higher than that of the aircraft designers and this was a serious disadvantage for me .The tray table ,the kind that drops down from the seat in front and the retractable one that is drawn out from the hand rest never fail to rest on my belly at an inclined angle. During meal times the food tray needs to be held with my left hand to prevent it from slipping away while feeding myself with the right. it cannot be a comfortable  position to enjoy any kind of food.  One could  probably do with an additional hand or two to hold on to the polythene / paper wrappers etc from flying all over the cabin while busy eating. Thanks to both my left and right helps they lent theirs . These are minor issues and turns major only to the oversized passenger concerned . An airline cannot be expected to look into this kind of individualistic problems,except perhaps suggest an upgrade to Business class.\n\nAs for the entertainment material ,they were  insipid for me, probably because of my outdated preferences but quite a treat to the majority of my fellow passengers around me.  Again an individualistic problem for which the airline cannot be blamed.In all fairness I must add they did have provision to add one's own entertainment material in the system .\n\nOf the four stretches I flew from Chennai to San Francisco and back  , the onward journey from Chennai to Singapore and there on to San Francisco was relatively less strenuous than the return journey. The stretch from San Francisco to Singapore was  upgraded to premium economy by Singapore Airlines itself at no extra cost as mentioned above . I don't have much to rave about the premium economy as compared to the economy sections. The minimum discomfort level was probably higher than the economy class. Blame my bulky build I must remember not to forget I am unfit for cattle and start thinking of business  for all my future flying plans. I should also not forget  that all air lines follow  equation between comfort and minimum discomfort and this could well be a hidden factor in classes other than economy too.\n\nThe flight to Chennai from Singapore, the last stretch , was memorable for the wrong reasons. It was an ageing aircraft.  This was quite apparent when I took my seat because the tray table in front of me was quite clear of my belly and the  space availability  was  also more than the other newer aircrafts we had flown earlier. My amateur deduction was confirmed when the plane took off with a resounding plane shattering noise and vibration that lasted for several minutes during and after take off .No one seemed to be concerned. Least of all the crew  and everyone ignored it as if it was a normal phenomena. It could  be due to a bad weather take off because weather did seem inclement even during mid flight. However  the very  same noise and vibration occurred during landing in Chennai where the environment appeared normal. Age perhaps was telling.\n\nCatering in this flight was executed in a haphazard  manner.Meal trolleys were absent and food trays were carried by hand by the crew member moving from galley to passengers several times and served at random order. The food was  below par but we ignored both the service and the food quality. We were reaching home and I was looking forward to it more than anything else\n\nThe final  hours of the flight was amusing. The pilot probably forgot to switch off the seatbelt sign after a brief period of turbulence during mid-flight and a steward who appeared to be a novice, prevented passengers from using the toilet pointing to the seat belt sign every time some one stood up looking towards the toilet. A few intrepid passengers  defied his instructions  when he was not looking and started walking towards the toilet. Several others followed suit and the line lengthened  and remained so for the next one hour till the captain announced the flight was starting the descent. During this period one of the senior stewardess was kind enough to help my ageing wife skip the line to a toilet ,probably intended for the crew.\n\nThe incident of using an ageing aircraft, the haphazard meal service and the unending toilet queue with a trainee crew member who was learning his ropes is indicative of indifferent attitude to this particular flight. There could be a very good reason for this but who wants to know. Not me. But the airlines  management probably know.\n\n I have been flying economy and business since 1968 in various airlines in various parts of the world and the term cattle class was unknown or was non-existent those days.  Economy those days could be  compared to business today. I have no comments on the economics of airline operations then or now  . I leave these to the experts to figure out the decline.",

                    "I used to be ambivalent about Singapore airlines but after flying Asiana business class, I now realise how good  Singapore airlines is.

                    "We've used Sinapore Airlines, (economy class), in the past and been happy with the service and food. This year we booked to fly to Melbourne, from Manchester, expecting the same good service.The first indication that things had changed occured not long after booking. We received an email stating that our flight times to Frankfurt had changed. In reality this meant we couldn't make the next stage flights to Melbourne. No alternative was provided and SA were not in the least bit bothered that we could no longer actually get to Melbourne. After an hour or more on the phone to SA my husband managed to get new flights. Sadly, this  poor service contined on the flights. The food was awful - poor quality. I wondered if it was just the gluten free meals, (bread roll still frozen to name just one problem),but my husband who had the standard food, also found some of it to be inedible. I was also offered snacks containing wheat/gluten even after I'd checked with the cabin crew that they were gf. Barely an apology and no alternative offered. In additon to this, not enough water offered on a flight of almost 14 hours - people had to keep going to the galley asking for drinks. The overall impression is that Singapore Airlines no longer care about their passengers. We most definately would not recommend.",

The plane was not cleaned properly and I found bits of food on my pillow and my tray table smeared with some food.

                    "My wife and I recently flew to and from Sydney to Singapore, travelling in Premium Economy. We were really looking forward to our Premium Economy experience with Singapore Airlines, especially after ready all of the positive reviews, including the accolades on Skytrax.\n\nWow, what a let down! \n\nFortunately I had booked the front row seats of Premium Economy, but besides the half an inch difference in seat width to economy (and that is questionable), and the legroom - this has to rate as one of my biggest disappointments in flying over all the years I have been doing this. \nThe crew were absolutely nowhere to be seen once we had taken \"taken to the skies\". Besides offering us a plastic cup of water an hour after take off - the crew were conspicuous by the absence. No snacks were offered, no refresher towels, no softdrinks or wine or something even a little stronger. After 2 hours, I took a stroll down to the galley, only to find 4 cabin crew staff all sitting eating and chatting to one another - way too busy to provide customer service to us paying passengers.\nIn addition to the complete lack of service, the menu was no different to economy class, unless you opted for the Book the Cook - which my wife and I did for breakfast. Not sure why we bothered, the so called scrambled eggs were so overdone, that they were almost blue - totally inedible. Our meal was served after economy class, as the crew started serving from the back of the aircraft - again, not sure why they call in Premium Economy?\n\nIf I compare this to the level of service received when flying Qantas (as an example), where we got sparkling wife before taking off (in a proper glass), fabulous food (different from economy), served on proper plates with steel cutlery, and the ever present crew attending to any customer needs (snacks, drinks, etc. - Singapore Airlines has a LOT of ground to make up.\n\nReally disappointed, and will definitely not waste my money fly Singapore Airlines Premium Economy again.\n\nVery disappointed Frequent Flyer",
                    "For all the talk and advertising about Singapore Airline, I must say it’s altogether a very average, unsurprising airline. A) The food is essentially Asian, not global, forcing the passenger to like Asian spicy cuisine, or go hungry for a long flight. B) The crew speaks English with a very heavy accent, making it rather unpleasant to interact with them because it’s not easy to understand them. C) Entertainment offers are centered on Asian and North American films; flying to so many countries in Europe, one would  expect it to have a greater variety. D) don’t be handicapped and in need of help at Singapore Airport; it’s sporadic slow and inefficient.",

Concerned with a slightly tight connection (time-wise) in Milan, I had opted to pay a little extra for a seat in the forward zone of the economy section.  And I lucked out as no one occupyied the seat next to me in the final row of the section.  With that extra space to stretch out during the flight, I managed to get a better-than-expected stretch of rest as the flight travelled through the night.  The service of the staff was very good - engaging without being unncessarily obstrusive when passengers preferred to sleep.  Supper and breakfast were fine, although I have to admit that portions seem to have become smaller recently with the disappearance of an appetiser and fruits, respectively.  And the loss of hot towels being handed out before meals is also rather disappointing (perhaps COVID has something to do with it).  Overall, a rather comfortable flight.",

                    "Not sure where to start on just how poor of a flying experience this was.  Let's start with booking.  The Singapore website is very difficult to use especially to compare flights on different dates, routes, etc.  I flew from SAN to SFO on Alaska Air and while I would have liked to book on a single ticket, I purposely booked separate tickets because in the past, creating a single ticket destroyed my ability to make changes without great difficulty.  Interestingly, the Alaska Air portion was not impacted.  Tiny Alaska Air has a more functional website than Singapore. This extends to the smartphone/tablet apps as well.  Poor integration of the website with the apps for Singapore.\n\nThe plane was new, clean, and nicely appointed and I sat in the premium economy.  This was an A350-900 and there was only business and premium economy classes.  Originally I was in one of the 'single' window seats towards the back of the plane but made a change to leave a day earlier and it wasn't available.  To be expected, but the downside is that you need to call Singapore to get your extra dollars for the better seat refunded.  Previous experience with Singapore's call center has made this not worth the effort.  They rarely answer the phone and a call back takes days.  And there's the Singapore accent that is even harder to understand over the phone.\n\nThe toilets in the premium economy section are extremely small and not conducive to good hygiene.  Too small to the point where it was preferable to dehydrate myself rather than use the toilet. They are the same size as Airbus single-aisle planes.  Maybe OK for a couple hour flight but not for a 16 hour flight.\n\nThe food was an 'economy class' meal service.  Quite disappointing given the several thousand dollar fare paid.   There were two meals served though I opted to skip the second meal preferring to get something in the airport instead. \n\nSome positives.  The flight was generally on time and the staff are friendly and professional.   The in flight entertainment was extensive, though Singpore is still using seatback systems versus personal devices.  (The touch screen feature at my seat was not working which was annoying.)\n\nI cannot recommend a flight on Singapore.  The only reason I flew Singapore was that they were the best way to get to my destination (Bali) as other airlines have not yet resumed flights.  Singapore needs to understand that online booking and flight management are important parts of the flying experience, especially for frequent and sophisticated flyers.  I won't fly Singapore again unless I have no choice.",
                    "Premium Economy choice between Qantas and Singapore Air?, easy, QF wins hands down! Took a flights between Australia and the Spain on SQ and would not waste my money on PE or Business Class in future, mediocre at best. We were treated better in Economy on SQ!!!",
                    "Barely any room to move, woke up to getting my knee crushed from the passenger in front of me reclining there seat back and was told it’s within their right to do so. Would not recommend flying economy with them if you are 6ft or taller.",
                    "Travelled with my partner and our two children to visit family in Ireland with a stopovers both ways. There was trouble from before we even flew when we weren't given the seats promised. My partner then had to spend several hours on the phone to try and get it all resolved only for it to be changed back anyway. The crux of the issue appeared to be that they left out youngest (<1) off our booking. She had a ticket but it wasn't connected to the rest of us. We ended up with 3 long haul flights with no kids meals. Even had one flight where the seat they had allocated for our 3 year old had her sitting by herself. We spent another 2 hours while on our holiday trying to sort it all out for our return leg but no one would take ownership. The call centre people wouldn't put us on to a supervisor and on more than one occasion even tried to end calls with us simply because they couldn't fix this issue. It was in the 'too hard' basket. We were promised call backs that never happened. We couldn't do online check in because of the issue which meant standing in queues for an age. When I tried to explain it all to the service desk in Singapore on our way home the best they could do was put us to the front of the queue after we'd already been waiting 45 mins. No apologies or even willingness to understand the issue. We paid a lot of money for these flights on the basis that Singapore Airlines is supposed to be good. They definately were not. We have flown with Emirates previously with our first child and the service we got from them was out of this world. Perhaps Singapore Airlines could learn a thing or two.",
                    "Pleasant flight for both of us seated in 46D & 46E. All efficient and friendly at check-in which helped us oldies understand new systems in use. Efficient boarding and on time departure. Well informed during flight. Enjoyed our meal and drinks. Very good selection of movies and music. WIFI available.  All good.",
                    "My wife and I traveled from Singapore to Perth with SQ223 today. The air stewardesses, particularly Ms Chan and Ms Regina Tan, were warm, pleasant and friendly. They were very attentive to our needs, helpful and reassuring. Kudos to these staffs who continue to up the ante providing better services during this covid time, maintaining Singapore Airlines as a great way to fly.",
                    "The crew were extremely friendly on their toes all the time taking good care \nThere was no need to buzz \nThey were so in tune with the passenger needs \n\nSpecial thanks to Jolene on my March 26 flight",
                    "My flight on Singapore Airlines was the best!  18 hours in a comfortable business class seat with full reclining seat.  I slept so well and I usually do not.  The food was so tasty and we were able to order ahead.  The flight crew was friendly and helpful.  \nI just can't say enough about this flight.  I had just flown to South Africa on a long flight and this was so much better- no comparison.",
                    "Very good comfort and exceptional service served by the professional SQ crews onboard. Foods quality is not bad but sleeping on the bed during the flight is nice. Enjoyed seating by the window. Enjoyed Singapore sling and lamb chops. Mee Siam is ok but needs improvement. Was hoping to book the cook - hainesese chicken rice but heard from friends that it's just average.  I wish to let you all at Singapore airlines know what can be improved for hainesese chicken rice - apparently more flavour?  🙏😃🇸🇬. The SIA lounge at terminal 3 was very good and got a lot of food choices to choose from. \n\nI would definitely recommend to anyone to try Singapore airlines as it's unique air experience. I have been flying with SIA quite a lot and will still use this airlines at some point in future.",
                    "Airbus 350..business class…the seats were obviously designed by the same person who designed Auntie Ann’s pretzels.  Flat but twisted…angled to the side with a small hole for your lower legs and feet.  Depending on which side of the aisle you’re on, you can lay on your left side or right side, but not both…you scrunch your torso into an “S” shape.  Okay, I’m 6’-2” …someone 5’ wont’ have the same challenges..  Jet Blue Mint experience is FAR better…",
                    "Having only flown charter or budget airlines we were excited to fly on this renowned airline. Was left dissapointed to be honest. The seats weren't very comfortable and less room than Thomas Cook or Tui in long haul. The food was hit and miss. Some OK some absolutely disgusting, with fish bones and scales in a meal described as chicken. Getting water was a chore and served in thimbles. Worrying on a 13 hour flight. Had no idea until near the end of a 13 hour flight that you could request snacks and alcohol (as none offered) from back of plane but pretty poor selection. IFE system very poor, irritating to navigate and poor selection. Games didn't work on any of the 4 legs we had. Again, much better selection on the cheap charter airlines. Only positives were the short legs from Singapore to siem reap and back. Much better service, same size seats! 737 cleaner and newer than the a380 or 777. Also enjoyed flying a380, very smooth flight on such a large aircraft. Would recommend Changi airport as a layover but not their national carrier.",
                    "Usually I love flying through Singapore and can’t fault their service however on my flight to London I got food poisoning from the eggs not being heated up correctly as they were served barely lukewarm (never had food poisoning before don’t judge me for my poor choice) and I contacted Singapore to let them know and heard nothing back at all, not even a simple apology. After spending 6 hours in hospital on an IV drip because I was unable to stop vomiting longer than 3 minutes I would think the least they would do is apologise? It’s really put me off flying with them next time I come to the UK",
                    "On a Sydney to Singapore flight the FAs basically ignored the Indian gentleman sitting next to me. Given he was sitting in the aisle seat this took some dedication. They refused to offer him drinks & even skipped serving him a meal. Even when I spoke up for him they never delivered him anything .\nIn 2023 this racist behavior is completely unacceptable I suggest you follow what I’ll be doing & boycott Singapore airlines. They shouldn’t even be in business if they are going to exhibit racist behavior towards their passengers. All these staff should be fired.\nFly QANTAS, Malaysian, Thai or any other decent airline. Do not give Singapore airline your business they don’t deserve it",
                    "Recently Singapore merged with Air India and we all know the poor service of Air India for years. Finally Singapore has decided to drop its standard along with just 1 meal in 8 hour flight. There was nothing else provided. I was more disappointed when they rescheduled the flight 45 mins early but in reality the flight left on its original time. So we spend 4 hours just at the airport. They use to provide hot towels in flight but not anymore. No new movies in flight entertainment. Cramped leg room and very limited service.",
                    "Travelled on Singapore Airlines with my husband and almost two year old twin daughters from Brisbane to Munich. Before leaving Australia I had called customer service to request that all our meals be made dairy free (including my two year old daughters). I was informed that I would be able to request this online. I made this request about two weeks prior to leaving; however, once on board our first flight from Brisbane to Singapore flight crew informed me that there were no dairy free meals available for our daughters. The flight crew tried to make a request for our next flight from Singapore to Munich but again there was no food available for them on this flight. I had packed back up food for them, but it is obviously difficult to travel over 35 hours with substantial meals. For these two long haul flights my daughters pretty much ate crackers and fruit the entire time. Crew on board told me to call customer service again before leaving Germany to ensure there would be dairy free meals for our flight back to Australia. \nI called Singapore Airlines two days before leaving Germany and was reassured that meals were already requested for my two daughters and that they would definitely be dairy free. Wouldn't we be surprised when the exact same thing happened. There was absolutely nothing they could eat. Flight crew told me that maybe customer service had misunderstood.\n\nUpon arriving home, I emailed Singapore Airlines to make a written complaint. Their response was that we had apparently changed seats on one flight and therefore the meal went to someone else (even though we had specifically asked for our meals, and crew told us there were none). They also informed me that i would have needed a doctors letter for these meals. This was the first time anyone had mentioned needing a doctors letter. Frankly, there handling of the whole situation is appalling and there have been non-stop excuses made for them failing to provide food.\n\nI've flown them many times before but definitely won't be again. ",
                    "Our experience with this airline was unmatched on our trip. The staff were attentive and lovely. We were in economy and had plenty of room. We didn't feel we needed to upgrade (which we felt on other airlines). The experience was wonderful and I couldn't recommend them enough.",
                    "All Cabin Crews were unbelievably welcoming, polite, helpful and attentive. The service onboard was second to none. Nothing  too kuch trouble for them.\n\nInflight meals from London to Singapore were lovely but from Singapore to Bangkok was disappointed. It was more like meal on a budget airline.\n\nToiletry kits were provided in lavatories even on a short haul flight from Singapore to Bangkok which was a nice touch. Lavatories were kept tidy & clean and snacks/drinks were well prepared in galleys between 2 meals tho.\n\nA Ground Staff working at the Luggage Claim at Bangkok Airport on Tuesday 16th January was efficient. He looked after all luggage coming out very well (around 14.30-15.00).",
                    "I flew in the rear of the plane this trip, very unuasual for me at my vintage. And I was delighted to see the attention to detail offered by the staff in every section of the plane. Even pre~boarding &  the check~in staff took the time, smiled and treated me a pleasing bag~tagging. \"Markia' & 'Zane' earned high marks from this Mark!  I asked to board early at the gate: I wanted to note the ebb & flow of boarding an airplane for an on~time departure... There were subtle, yet wonderful difference in helping customers. Crew helped shuffle overhead bins as needed...Other airline staff stand~off and leave it to the pax to sort... Observant SQ team members worked smoothly to re~unite families with small children, helped with the need for another pillow or blanket,and thrughout the flight, seemed to pay special attention to their customers... A special shout~out to 'David\" and his peers at the back of the plane! Good service starts at the top...so we need to say thanks to the burser on~board,'James' who clearly led by example... For this entire team, they appeared to be honoured to be flying...other carriers seem to have staff that see this line of WORK as a real 'chore'... At This airline, it appears to be more of an honoured VOCATION to serve...Keep it Up Singapore! ",
                    "Use to love this Airline but the this experience was way below what they use to be and more expensive. The food was poor and although cabin staff were nice very little was offered as far as refreshments. Singapore Airlines has definitely lost what was once considered one of the best Airlines in the world and are now very average.",
                    "Singapore Airlines generally have a reputation for providing excellent service, and so we booked a Premium Economy flight SQ308 from Singapore to London, on 18 September 2023. Prior to this flight, we took a Scoot flight Melbourne to Singapore, again in Premium Economy, which was excellent, sitting in seats 1A and 1B.\n\nThe Singapore Airlines flight was disappointing in a number of areas.\nWe were not offered a glass of champagne on boarding, no flight menu was offered, no amenities kit, and very sparse service of drinks, in plastic cups (not glass). We had pre-ordered meals, my wife’s meal was first given to another passenger who opened it, realized it wasn’t theirs, and returned it to the hostess, who then read the correct seat number and offered it to my wife, opened!\nI had to request more wine during the meal, it was not offered.\n\nAll in all, a most disappointing flight. We have Premium Economy flights booked on our return journey, not really looking forward to those.\n\nI would chose QANTAS Premium Economy in the future. Not good enough Singapore!",
                    "I flew a 15 hour flight from SEA to SIN. The flight attendants were outstanding in their wanting to help passengers. I noticed that a Margarita pizza is offered for a snack, and also another one brisket with noodles. I decided to make Brisket pizza with those two snacks. I added from the Noodles dish some brisket, mushrooms, and red peppers.\nIt turned out fine but, a little spicy because of the flavoring in the Noidle dish.\nEnclosed are pics of the new dish, and one of the Noodles dish.\nI was worried that I could not get my connecting flight boarding pass, a revised E- Arrival card, and book a new free tour but, a Mr. Ng a flight attendant on the flight , came to my rescue, and assured me that someone will at the airport will help me get all of the mentioned things that I need. On the flight he told me several times not to worry, and my issues were resolved.",
                    "First time in a very long time to fly SQ business class and as much as their hard product is good their staff is exceptional. \nAbout half way through our flight got a bit bumpy which our 1 1/2 year old really did not like in that he got what we thought was airsickness (later turned out it was Gastro) The staff went above an beyond to ensure the rest of the flight went as well as possible even making up one of the spare seats.\n\nThe seats themselves are a bit mixed, yes you can lie flay but you need to sleep at an angle as your feet need to fit into a cubbyhole.  Also the seat has to be turned into a bed instead of just reclining. The plus is the food and selection of beverages offered and the option of pre-odering your meals.",
                    "Just travelled Business Class on Singapore Airlines (Bne –Sing- Bkk return, out early March, back late April), sorry NOT good.  The hype about Singapore Airlines Business class is a lie. The worst business class service I have ever experience. SQ 246 / 235 & SQ 709 / 706 on A350-900 aircraft.  On 3 of the fights I had the nasty small business class seats and only 1 flight the bigger long haul seat, which is what all business class seat should be like.  All the seats are poorly designed. So frustrating as small changes could make a huge difference.  On the small nasty seats you cannot stretch your legs out straight (must be angled) and on all flights everything (controls and the like) are behind you, very difficult to reach. I am big guy (fat) which is why I pay 4 times the cost of economy, to get more room (and bitter service).  None of the tray tables had adjustment, so I could not use them or had to force it into my stomach for my premium economy quality meal service. They used a drink cart like in economy !  No hot / cold towel or drink prefight.  I was not greeted by name. No lay flat seat, no night turn down service. All very ordinary.  Out bound (Bne-Sing-Bkk) 3/10 rating.  Now 7 weeks later I had many of the same issues, but was lucky enough to get seats near the galley i.e. no seat Infront of me so the arrangement was different.   The long haul plane (Bkk-Sing 2.5 hours) had a much wider seat that was nice but the same stupid issue with the tray table that folds out from the armrest and no slide adjustment, I ended up putting the meal on the foot rest/shelf in front and holding the dishes as I ate. At least in this seat I did not need a belt extension. On the next flight (Sing- Bne, 6.5 hours) back to the nasty small seats and the tray table pulled out from the cabinet in front and not out from the arm rest as the other 3 flights were configured and although I could not extend it into its locked position I could at least eat from it.  However, to give Sing Air due credit, the service and food was much improved. Home bound (Bkk-Sing) 3/10 rating, (Sing-Bne) 6/10.\n\nI have previously flown international business class on:  Qantas, Qatar (the best), Malaysia, Thai and now Singapore.",
                    "Took off from Changi AP at 00:45 13/11/2022\n\nSingapore Air used to be an excellent Airline in the past, not anymore and its service goest down to the tube. Its airfares are not so competitive with other, similar to its cousin SCOOT.\n\nNot a welcome drink ( orange juice or water), put guests to sleep straight away and no sign of crew around.\nOnly one meal served during 8 hours flight, 2 hours before landing at Sydney AP, no snack, no refreshment. \nCrew served meal, rushed out to traveller and did not offer refilling tea or coffee as usual, rudely and walked away with few requests from other travellers. Perhaps guests on board are beggars.",

                    "Usually I like Singapore airlines but was not happy to see dirty food tray.. when I showed this to the steward, instead of cleaning they gave me cleaning wipe to clean it.. why should I clean someone's mess?? \nFirstly it was dirty and than I ended up cleaning myself as Steward didn't have courtesy to apologize and clean the surface..",
                    "Very disappointed in the business class seat.  Was narrow and not comfortable.  The food was fair and the service was fair.  Not up to their past reputation.  seems like they are trying to make up for Covid losses.",
                    "We flew from Sydney to Penang on Singapore Airlines and it is easy to see how they keep winning so many awards. Easy check in via the automated kiosk system, boarding was simple on both flights and the flight itself was great. The staff are helpful and very friendly. Both flights were on very comfortable aircraft (A350 & B738MAX) and overall it was a great experience and a wonderful start to a three week trip.",
                    "Firstly, the staff on the plane were fantastic and helpful. I have no complaints for them.\nThe complaints all come from the company itself. It used to be a luxury airline to fly with. Now they have gone the same way as British Airways and become a disappointment. \nNo over-ear head phones, just little cheap buds that are difficult to hear with. The food is really cheap and bad.\nBoarding happens from only the front of the plane. They let business board, then after a few minutes they let economy board walking straight passed their not so private business seats.\n\nI highly suggest avoiding Singapore Airways now and take a cheaper flight.",
                    "We paid extra to fly Singapore airlines because of their reputation but were incredibly disappointed. We flew out on an A380 and back on a Boing 777.\n\nSeating ;It would seem that the introduction or Premium economy has meant the downgrading of economy resulting in cramped and uncomfortable seats.  I am 5ft 8 weighing 146lbs and my wife is 5ft 4 weighing 126lbs i.e both small and yet we were in discomfort the entire 13 plus hours on the plane. The seats were uncomfortable and the actual legroom worse on any plane that I have flown on for the last 30 years.\n\nFacilities:  These would have been ok but one of the toilets was without water although a bottle was provided.\n\nFood:  I am Coelic (cannot have Gluten) and my wife is vegetarian. We notified the airline 6 months in advance and it was registered in the app. The flights were not made aware of this even though I could show them the Singapore Airlines app with the dietary requirements. On the way out a vegetarian meal was not available for my wife. After some searching  I was provided with a gluten free meal and then the hostess placed a normal gluten bun on the top making it inedible.  On the way back the only meal I could be offered was breakfast consisting of a vegetable curry which was not very palatable as a breakfast.  The drinks are served in flimsy plastic cups, the sort that you might get from a water fountain.  These were so flimsy they deformed in your hand making drinking from them difficult.  At main meal times no tea or coffee was available.\n\nService:  I had heard so many good things about the service but it was inattentive and lacking.  On a 13 1/2 hour flight I expected frequent supply of water an drinks.  These were not proactively made.\n\n In Flight entertainment:  The choice of films was ok and on par with some of the better airlines.  I was disappointed that every film started with a bunch of advertisements for watches and lifestyle products that could take up to 5 minutes before the start of the film.  This was unexpected and irritating.\n\n",
                    "My 2 years old baby was too tired after nearly haft day discover the terminal so he slept right after enter the airplane. But then he was asked to sit up for landing off. Though I tried to explain that he has just slept and we already set the belt on him or I hold him with me but all the crew don’t care about that and still ask me to keep him sit up. My boy then cry out lound for nearly 15mins while the plane go around before landing off but the crew still don’t care at all. Later, he awake and can’t sleep again.\n\nDon’t understand  why a 5 stars airlines have that stricky way to deal with baby. \nThis might be the first and also the last time me and my family flight with Singapore airlines.",
                    "We flew Singapore Airlines in 2018 in Premium Economy and I found it overall a good experience. However, this time the experience was a little disappointing. In 2018 we had been offered an aperitif before our meal. Not this time. I had expected the food to be between Economy and Business quality; but no, definitely the same as Economy. In fact the staff almost threw the food at us - dessert served about 2 minutes into eating the main course. The worst thing was - on a 12 hour flight - we were given a meal then NO FOOD for about the next 9 hours when breakfast was served. We were so hungry I went to the back of the plane and begged some snacks.\nLiked the extra space and the better headphones, but will not be using Singapore Airlines again. The accountants have moved in and a previously semi-luxurious experience is now very much an economy affair. Emirates next time I think.",

                    "12hrs on a long haul flight is always a hard task in economy. Even though the company  is great and the service always excellent, a standard economy seat is not the most comfortable place for 12hrs sitting down. \nThe plane was an A350-900 and it was very clean inside as usual. \nHowever, the flight boarded on time and left on time which is good. It was late when we left and followed the night all the flight. The staff served the 1st meal and then the lights were dimmed. The food was plane but nourishing, still a nice little meal. The staff kept up a supply of water and juice all flight and attended everyone's needs well. The staff are always excellent and I cant say anything negative about the experience. There was turbulence for about 4hrs after the dinner service and then it was smooth after that. I like the supply of toothpaste and toothbrushes in the toilets, it is very freshening to be able to brush your teeth on a flight. We arrived into Munich on a foggy morning and I actually felt refreshed after having a sleep on the flight. Thanks to the Singapore team for a great flight.",

The design of the seat in the A380 is so flawed it’s incredible considering how good everything else is at Singapore airlines that it was introduced. It’s set at an angle which means you have to lay offset and only in one direction. The surface is made up of the seat and an extension, it’s not level and hard as rock. My wife is 5 3, I’m 6 3 and we have the same view, our friends also had the same opinion. We will never fly Sing again on an A380, we all chose to pay a lot of money for this privilege, it’s just shockingly bad and unacceptable.",

                    "Flown more than 100 times on SIA, never wrote a review. But today I feel compelled to write about their drastic declining standards of service inflight. Up to recently they started with a drinks service and nuts or small savouries. This has been cancelled completely they start with the meal service straight away. In the past the main meal used to consist of a starter, main course, followed by biscuits and cheese and a dessert. They have now scrapped the starter and the biscuits and cheese, just a main course and some ice cream. They used to walk up and down the aisle during the 12 hour flight, offering drinks throughout the flight. This was sadly lacking and the crew disappeared completely for several hours. This is certainly not the service that I used to get from SIA. There is a good reason why I used to chose SIA, but if their service has now sunk to the level of all their competitors, I have no more reason to select SIA for my long haul travel, and will be looking at alternatives. What a shame!",

Even the booking of legroom seats was only possible by telephone and not via the web.",
                    "My route is flying back to the US using SQ from Bali, and transit in Frankfurt. Bali to Singapore operated with their low cost airline, scoot. Very basic service like the other low cost airline, so I cannot command much. Singapore to Frankfurt, 12 hours flight: terrible Meals, no snack in between this long hours flight, no in flight meal purchase option despite their terrible meal option. So basically you stuck with their horrible meal and other amenities. Cold bread, no salad or fruit, and very poor meal selection. No game in flight as you need your own device, poor selection of movie. The only thing they offer I observe during my total 20++ hours flight back to the states is WATER. Frankfurt to NY, 8 hours flight, another horrible experience. Same movie selections from the previous flight (Singapore to Frankfurt), the meals option is even worse as the flight attendants refer this as not a long flight despite it is 8 hours flight with no other option of their poor meals and limited entertainment. 1st meal is maincourse, second one is a very basic pork/vegetarian sandwich. The flight attendant mention \"we don't have in flight purchase meal or snack for passengers, whatever we have we will give it to you.\" However, they do not have anything to offer to you. Comparing to my experience with SQ before the covid situation, flying with them in the same economy class, they used to give you warm towels after you boarding to the airplane, and before each meal, warm bread, fruit or salads in every meals, ice cream in between of the flight hours or different variety of snacks, eye masks, which I refer it as a great memorable experience with them. With my recent flight with them, I don't have any good thing to remember during my flight from Bali to NY beside a boring long hours flight. Based on my recent experience with SQ, I don't think this airline deserves a 5 star airline rating if I compare it with another 5 star airline like Emirates or Qatar, flying in the same economy class. For me SQ nowadays is like a budget low cost airline which claim to be a 5 star. For the price that slightly cheaper than Emirates, I don't think is worth it to fly with SQ and I will definitely not recommend this airline for a long hour flight to anyone.",

Food was served 2.5-3 hrs post we took off.\nFirst the flight got delayed coz of technical difficulties.\nThe did not inform the order of serving meals, every crew member kept telling us 10 minutes but eventually took 2-2.5 hour for the food to come. \nI’m typing this whilst we hear all of this from them and without even a smallest of apology. \nVery rude crew.\nWater service was delayed and once the crew came she literally had the audacity to ask me to wait for two mins to get me water. She said my colleague is serving alcohol for other guests, she will come and serve you water when she comes close to your seat. LOL \n\nHorrible. \nNever booking again.\n\nFor the ones who are planning to book \nPls pre order your meals or you might just die of hunger. Or as the crew said these are “Special Meals” \n\nThe lady crew except Mahalakshmi were rude to a level where it was very difficult to sit in the flight. Mahalakshmi was very polite and sweet. \nThe gentlemen crew were decently polite. ",
                    "We had an absolutely amazing trip with Singapore airlines. Both of us travelling requested vegan meals and the airline was so efficient in both their recognition of this dietary requirement and also the delivery. Within minutes of being on the flight one of the friendly team came round and placed a sticker on our seat, we were then offered meals in advance of other guests ( Advantage of having a vegan meal), the food was incredible quality, lots of vegetables and  Nutritionally well-balanced, would definitely fly with Singapore again",

My seat from Brisbane to Singapore was quite uncomfortable. \n\nWifi on the way back didn't work because apparently krisflyers members don't get complimentary wifi anymore, although their app says they do. When I told the crew, they told me the app was out of date and they didn't really help nor offer alternatives.\n\nAt Brisbane airport I waited 1.5 hours to check in, and the app didn't let me check in online.\n\nThe app also doesn't really work, it's slow and it's very messy with a lot of hidden pages that are not east to find.\n\nLastly, Singapore airport is so bad. At 6am only a couple of cafes open (waited 25 minutes in a line to get a cappuccino) and not much space to sit.",

The 777 flight Auckland to Changi is OK, the private room is a bonus while we wait for our next flight to Paris CDG on SQ's A380.  The suites and service 'WERE' incomparable. \nMid Covid (June 2020). The A350 used on the Changi - CDG leg was frankly a disgrace.  It was old, tatty and dirty.  The crew were at their usual best.  The seat was uncomfortable and in need of new upholstery. This aircraft was a salute lesson on how to disappoint a customer.  However, we blame Covid.\nPost Covid (June 2021 and 22).  Same awful aircraft, nothing has changed. Crew are still superb though. The purser on board whispers to me that lots of passengers are complaining.\nPost Covid (June 2023)  We have booked on Emirates A380.  NZD18K each. These fares are insane.

The food was good (took me by surprise as I'm yet to taste good in-flight food) , the seats were as expected in economy with the leg space being really good. The staff were polite and accommodating. Despite their busy schedule, they helped change a couple of food orders for my family.\nHighly recommended airline for economy travellers!",
                    "After flying a few times with Singapore Economy Class I decided to splurge and try Business Class, but I was disappointed for one main reason: I remember the slogan for Singapore Airlines used to be, 'Singapore Girl, you're a great way to fly!', and this is one of the rare cases of 'truth' in advertising and one of the main selling points and points of difference for Singapore airlines. But obviously, this slogan is not very PC or woke, and is no longer used because of those reasons; but that does not mean it isn't true or effective marketing. But worse than that, the Business class cabin was staffed by way too many male flight attendants; and even worse, the 'team leader' for all the flight attendants on all Singapore Airlines fights I have experienced (business and economy) was a man! So, Singapore Airlines have gone from 'Singapore Girl, you're a great way to fly!', to way too many male flight attendants and not even a Singapore girl or woman being the the boss of the inflight cabin crew! That is extremely stupid and disappointing! For Singapore Airlines to relinquish one of the best and most truthful slogans in airline marketing history because of woke or otherwise pressure is political correctness and 'equal opportunity' gone mad! Isn't it funny that for years women strive for equal opportunity to no avail, but when whining men cry for the same it is instantly realised to the detriment of everybody, including an airline's effective marketing slogan. The vocation of flight attendant is a 'care' vocation, like a tour guide, like child care, like elderly care, men should not do it. I will avoid Singapore Airlines in the future for this very reason: 'Singapore 'Man', you're NOT a great way to fly.",

The food is just average, served in the same presentation as economy even you select meals from Book the Cook. Toilet is shared with economy passenger so very crowded and dirty.  In-flight snacks are carefully hidden and guarded in galley that you need to ask what you want to cabin crew rather than enjoying selection.  I will take Emirates or Qatar next time. No more SG.",

In the side seats there is a natural cushioned footrest on the side crease which is comforting throughout the flight. (It is fixed and needs not to be pulled or pushed).\n\nThe F&B service and the crew is very polite and caring. The F&B selection is was good on this flight, but sometimes its really not upto the mark.\n\nOne can even try and book the front row seats which have a very comfortable and wide front den for foot rest.\n\nMuch thanks to: \nChief: Jamie\nLeading Steward: Leslie\nSteward: Sean, Jeanette, Stella, Yi Jie and Isabel.\n",

Lounge access is not really a positive anymore, the Changi lounge is so packed you cannot find a seat, and when you do, the cleanliness leaves much to be desired (tables full of rubbish).\n\nTrying to earn miles is also made frustrating. If you pay for a couple tickets with the same cards, your miles are split across two passports, because forbid it that families travel together.\n\nSave yourself the trouble and pick one of their cheaper competitors, and purchase that upgrade in cash.",

So the flight from Brisbane to Singapore has an updated aircraft which has a better seat configuration 1-2-1, no welcome drink, (no hot towels menus mags or duty free because of covid) food and service was OK on that flight and we had lounge access before boarding flight from Singapore to Manchester, no welcome drink, they still have those badly designed big seats on SQ51 (12 hour flight) food OK and was told 2 hours before landing they may not be able to serve breakfast but they did and so they should, so all in all pretty ordinary.\nBut then return flights from Manchester to Brisbane were not good, check in was chaos due to all Dpd covid forms, no priorty lane for security, so SQ52 to singapore no lounge access at singapore lounge if you were travelling from Europe even though triple vaccd and neg pcr test, again no welcome drink, no drink after take off either this time, I ordered lamb loin, the meals came out economy style all on a tray, I had to send mine back as I couldn't cut it it was so tough, I complained and was told I would have to wait 20 minutes for another meal, chicken curry and rice which came out cold, at that stage I couldn't be bothered sending back, I could hear other passengers complaining, crew disappeared and if you wanted anything you had to call for service, I felt like a leper, breakfast was pleasant and hot, upon arrival to Singapore we were to go to a holding pen but our flight was late so we were escorted to the gate, sq236  to Brisbane breakfast was served, good job I ate it as no other meal was served on this 7.5 hour flight, crew disappeared quickly after breakfast and no drink service of any kind unless you asked for it and then you got a a bag of nuts or crisps, I think standards have really slipped and covid is being used as an excuse for some of it, I wouldn't fly with SIA unless I had to, I usually fly with Etihad who provide a much better service but unfortunately not currently flying direct from Brisbane",

Power sockets can also be found in-between the seats, and in the back of the seat in front of you there is also a folding table a new updated IFE system and a USB port and a cup holder for your drinks.\n\nThe aircraft a modern and the Dreamliner offers a very quiet inflight experience and Singapore Airlines as usual offer very good in flight cabin service.\n\nI would recommend their economy product as its comfortable and clean and  it was an enjoyable experience\n\nSingapore Airlines has switched to the earbuds instead of those crappy sounding over-ear headphones.",
                    "I splurged a bit on my flight back to the US from Thailand earlier this year, and took business class on Singapore Airlines. The experience showed me why it has been voted the #1 airline in the world so many times. It was only about 2 hours from BKK to Changi Airport in Singapore, so that wasn't enough to really gauge the experience, but the 14+ hours from there back to LA really did. I felt like I was in a 5-star hotel with its own Michelin-starred restaurant. The meals were fantastic, and there was a lot of food with which meal. A LOT!  The biz class seats with their lie-flat bed abilities made for real sleep on the overnight flight when the time came. \n\nThe level of service from the cabin crew was every bit as exceptional. You can always tell when a cabin crew is genuinely pleased to have you on board and interested in your well-being, as opposed to just acting like it because they are supposed to. Every interaction on had with them, from the moment I boarded to leaving the plane in LA, showed how much they cared about their passengers. \n\nThe best I've experienced. No question about it.",

                    "My partner and I visited the lounge twice (September 22 and June23).\nBoth times we experienced the same problems - surly staff, poor food and the worst, showers/toilet cubicles which weren't operational.\n\nThe furniture has now seen better days and needs upgrading. \n\nFood was breakfast each time and poorly catered for vegetarians.\n\nThe lounge has male and female toilets as well as a unisex shower facility which has around 5 cubicles. \n\nThe first time we went in September 22 I used the shower facilities to go the toilet which they also have in the cubicle. When I emerged, I was berated by a female member of staff for using them & told they were only for booked shower sessions. No one else was using the cubicles at the time and with only 4 areas within the male toilets to use, didn't think this was a problem given over 80 people were in the lounge at the time with 2 flights scheduled.\n\nThe next time of our visit was more recently in June 23 only the situation with the bathroom facility had gotten worse. The same rude member of staff was still there but this time she had placed 5 \"Out of order notices\" on each of the 5 shower cubicles. When I asked if they could be used, again I was berated and told that they needed to be booked in advance??? \"Were they working and can be used?\" was my reply. She just kept shouting at me and telling me to use the male toilets instead.\n\nI suspect the shower cubicles were in working order at the time but due to the staff member not wanting to clean them after customer use, put the notices up.\n\nThis wasn't the professional experience we were expecting with Singapore Airlines given the long flight ahead we wanted as stress free and experience but unfortunately the opposite occurred.\n\nSingapore Airlines needs to up their game and quickly correct the above issues at the lounge for an approved passenger experience.",

We had booked seats as I wanted to be able to see the engines and the seat was excellent for this. We booked seats 43A&B which were forward economy seats so we were the last group to board.\nThe seat was a standard economy seat with the only issue being a small metal box cutting into the footwell for seat 43A. Not much but just enough to be a pain.\nI really enjoyed take off and landing with the view of the engines.\nThe service again from the Air Singapore crew was excellent. Very attentive and professional. The inflight entertainment system, KrisWorld, is excellent and has something for everyone. It was a 12hr flight which is long when flying in economy.\nThe A380-800 was very clean inside.\nOne thing I did note on the bottom level window seat was the bulkhead is about 9 inches away from the seat so it makes resting the pillow against the window impossible to sleep on. When on the A350's, the gap is better for this.\nStill, an excellent flight and great service from the Singapore team. Although we had a delay, they had rebooked everything and informed us every step of the way and helped everyone make connections when the plane landed in Singapore. Still not a fan of 12 hour layovers though, but they did their best for us. Will definitely fly these guys again.",

The food was nothing special. We felt very tired and disappointed so tried to upgrade to business class at the Singapore airline counter at Singapore airport. No one was particularly interested in listening to our problem and only offered us an exorbitant price to upgrade one leg to Manchester. I don’t understand why we can’t negotiate on these fare upgrades considering there were plenty of empty seats in Business Class. We have to travel back to Melbourne on the 1st October and are not looking forward to it. We wouldn’t recommend Singapore airlines. ",

I read the CEO said they are in the black but are saving for a rainy day which is why they are not reinstating the way it used to be. Sad isn't it.  Profit before paying passengers. We left half an hour late (no big deal), arrived on time (always a bonus).  The meal itself was small and not very nice at all. The snack was inedible. The staff don't seem as friendly as they once were. All in all, why bother spending a lot to fly with them. There are other choices and perhaps it is time to explore those.

Poor sleep compounded by cabin service - see below.\n\nInfotainment worked well but screen was offset in my seat and so far away the screen was effectively tiny.\n\nCheckin was painless albeit clunky on a smartphone with a pre smartphone era process.\n\nOnboarding was bizarre in surabaya with an attendant using a poor quality belt amplifier and microphone to blare incomprehensible instructions at passengers. \n\nBoarding the a380 and then waiting 20mins for take-off was very slow- downside of a large plane most probably. Egress and baggsge was also slow probably also due to the size of the aircraft.\n\nThere was no food choice from surabaya as the better smelling option ran out. The laksa was average but the included bread roll was gross and tasted like it was full of sugar and preservatives and baked a week ago. The cake was also sickly sweet. Would have preferred some healthy food although a meal order may be a way to achieve this.\n\nOrder of serving passengers was also seemingly random on both flights. Waited 10 mins while passengers in front, beside and behind were served and yet others were waiting.\n\nMost irritating part of the a380 flight was being knocked and brushed against by the stewardess 20 times for an overnight flight without leaning into the aisle significantly. Use of a quiet voice at night time would have been great too. This problem could be mitigated by avoiding the a380 seats with extra legroom - I had no choice as other passengers had already selected seats.",

On seeing that the flight was 13 hours and not being the best flyer in the world, I was a bit apprehensive of how I was going to be cooped up in a seat for that amount of time.\n We flew on a Boeing 777Er aircraft which I have to say Singapore airlines have done a great job giving you ample leg room. I am not a small bloke at 6 foot 1 and 100 kilos, but found the room allowed was plenty for me. Entertainment is excellent in the in flight screens (although I am much happier with the screen that tells me what is going on, how fast we are going, progress along route etc). My wife who has a problem knee was dreading the flight, but I have to say she really enjoyed the movie marathon she undertook and her knee really wasnt an issue. The flight passed much faster than I expected (even though I cant sleep!) .\n The cabin crew were very attentive and nothing was too much trouble, the food as always on Singapore airlines was very good, seats were comfortable and were arrived at Changi airport (WOW) still feeling quite fresh. \n Luggage arrival at the Carousels was quick enough. \n All in all a fantastic experience and cannot wait until we are able to do it again.",
                    "We have flown Singapore Air a lot of times over the last 20 years from London to Sydney and always rated them highly for inflight service. After our recent flights from Male to Singapore to Sydney, the service was so bad that we will never fly Singapore Air again. \nOn the Singapore to Sydney flight, no food or drink was served for FIVE hours into the flight. \nI complained to them afterwards and the answer was that it was due to turbulence, which was NOT TRUE. \nWhen I pointed this out to them their next response was that this was their policy!\n\nNEVER AGAIN WILL WE FLY SINGAPORE AIR",
                    "Lounge : SilverKris Lounge , Terminal 3\nOur incoming flight arrived at T1 , forcing us to take the overcrowded Skytrain to T3 ( as the only functional SilverKris Lounge is located there ). What a nightmare !! Just 2 coaches per train , filling up with hundreds of passengers at once , and people sneezing / coughing right on your face. Strange that the \"best airport in the world\" violates Covid-19 protocols of its own country.\nThe lounge was as overcrowded as seen during our previous time here. Not even a single seat available. What is the point of a multi-million dollar renovation , if they could not even plan the seating correctly. This is the least they could have done , considering that every premium passenger flying on any Star Alliance flight can access this lounge.\n\nBoarding / Security : Our flight was assigned a gate at T1 ( as T3 conveniently shuts shop at night ). We left the lounge 1 HOUR EARLY. Our flight at 02:35 was the last SQ flight for the night. But even then , the lounge staff did not feel that it's their duty to inform us about the shocker that lay ahead.\nTHE SKYTRAIN STOPS OPERATING AT 01:30. And still this airport wins awards all the time. Absurd.\nWe had no option but to walk / run as fast as we could. It still took us almost 20 minutes to reach our gate.\nSecurity Check happens at the gate , one of the biggest flaws of this airport. But what makes it worse is the overtly rude security staff. A lady in front of us was having some trouble , but rather than being patient they started shouting at her for no reason at all. Passports / Boarding Passes are snatched out of your hands and thrown back at you. Also , a so-called \"5 star airline\" like SQ does not deserve that status , considering that they're unable to provide Fast-Track Immigration / Security at their own hub.\nBoarding was via a dedicated aerobridge.\n\nSeat / Layout : Just like their A350 , the B787-10 too has a 1-2-1 staggered layout in Business Class , with seats either close to the aisle or away ( the latter being more private ). The footrest is right in front , not angulated as seen on the A380 , ensuring a much better sleep.\n\nService : Fabulous. Very courteous crew.\n\nFood & Beverages : We availed the 'Book the Cook' service. Loved Song Fa's 'Bak Kut Teh' and 'Qui Lian Ban Mian'\n\nArrival : A dedicated Immigration counter for First / Business Class passengers. Luggage arrived on the belt on a priority basis as well.",
                    "Cockroaches crawling out of overhead lockers.\nQuite a small plane used for an international, four hour leg to Kolkata - I think the seats on an AirAsia flight I took in India had more leg room than this flight.\nMeals were generally quite poor with some exceptions (the food served in 2nd class on Indian Railways was better) and one breakfast consisted of a bread roll, a yoghurt and a small cake (see photo below). Staff slow to bring water and drinks.\nI don't understand how Singapore Airlines has achieved such a high ranking.",
                    "Decided to treat myself and fly first class for the first time in my 62 years.\nWhat a wonderful experience. The 3 member crew looking after me were great, as was the whole experience. Thank you so much for a great flight : )",
                    "While not perhaps as good as pre Covid, Singapore First Suites remains pretty good! Service is good and of course there is plenty of room in the suite. Food is perhaps not as good as before. The First Class Lounge in SIN was closed so that made for a not so good stopover. \nThese points aside though, it's hard to beat but of course at those prices so it should be!",

                    "I recently flew on flight SQ241 from Singapore to Sydney.\n\nBeing Thailand based, I fly very often on this route and the carrier I use are mainly Thai Airways or Singapore Airlines. On my several occasions flying on Singapore Airlines, I experience the same reoccurring nightmare on my inflight experience in economy class that I question their sequence of service in this cabin.\n\nI am not a fussy nor needy traveler, but I have year of travel experience to give an opinion. This nightmare has become unbearable for me and want to share my experience.\n\nWe all know that crew members attend briefing, and all crew knows the flight profile of the flight. SQ241 & SQ211 flights, has lots of connecting passengers from India. Lots of special meals, babies & bassinet requests, and wheelchairs etc.\n\nFlight often delayed due to connecting passengers. Understandable.\n\nFirst meal service begins from the front of economy class cabin. Continental breakfast (no big deal) easy on the crew, drop food trays on tray tables, coffee/tea/juice etc. Special drinks request is still manageable as crew often don’t stock various soft drinks in their trolleys. The crew must run up and down the aisle to get stock for passengers. Yes, I get it when stock runs down during service but not every time a passenger ask for soda water and the crew keep running back and forth. This part I don’t get it. \n\nI have seen in other airlines that I have travelled with has one dedicated crew doing drinks cart (including mixers and cocktails) and one dedicated to doing meal trays. The crew that does the meal services cart than come back to help with drinks services once all the meals trays are on tray tables. \n\nSome airlines have some form of liquid to offer you with your meal tray i.e., sealed cup or bottle of water or a terra pack of juice (something small) to tie the pax for the moment until the drinks trolley comes to their section for more drinks or special drinks.\n\nFor the main meal before landing, the crew took a long time to sort out special meals. Seem like there was lots of confusion and missed meals for passengers. The plane was full of passengers from India. They are around me and I can hear their request/demands to why their meals are not served yet and are wrong meals. As confirmed by a crew member when we asked.\n\nI was served my meal 40mins before landing. Being at the front of the cabin, you are being served last because the meal service begins from the back of the cabin this time. We could have been served in a timely manner if your senior crew is organized with their special meals request.\n\n10 mins into my meal, the captain announces to crew to prepare cabin for landing. I had to rush thru my meal and finish quickly. My request for a soda water could not be fulfilled (can you guess why…. crew were trying to feed passengers and clear trays at the same time, plus they do not stock sufficient soft drinks in their trolley.) so I settle for an apple juice. No big deal.\n\nIt was in the last 20mins before landing that I saw 3 crew members from business class came to economy class to help the crew to prepare the cabin for landing. Stowing away passenger’s luggage/bags, bassinets, taking food trays away etc. Wonder where the co-operations amongst crews went in the earlier part of the crisis. We understand crews has specific duties to perform but it was a crisis in economy class but no sign of any camaraderie on that flight amongst crew.\n\nSo, with that said, we asked to speak with a senior member of the crew in charge of the cabin (red kabeya) but she did not turn up. It took a second request that she finally came to have a word with us. \n\nShe knew everything that we had to tell her. She even said that we know more than her and the crew members.\n\nCrew members attend pre-flight briefing, if you know that you have over demands for special meals request what would you do?\n\nCrisis management, getting help from other cabin crew when there is a crunch in Economy class. Is the senior crew in red kabeya afraid that her integrity be questioned or will she loose face because she did not plan her workflow properly? Or that’s our (SQ) procedure and policy, we are adhering to it! (Heard that excuse from a crew member before on other SQ flights to Sydney)\n\nSo, in conclusion, Singapore Airlines over the years have hyped up travelers’ expectations when flying on Singapore Airlines. Even more now with this “world class” thing that we see advertised all over the world.\n\nIt is very difficult to be reasonable and forgiving even in the smallest glitch that may occur, be it the service or the hardware. It’s supposed to be “world class” and that is everything you do; it’s supposed to be perfection. It’s supposed to be 6-star hospitality.\n\nWith no help from social media, lots of good and bad comments are floating out there, some are legit, and some are just pure unreasonable. I am sure you have a team to look at those to decipher and respond.\n\nPersonally, I will refrain from flying this route on Singapore Airlines. One less passenger/s will not make a difference to your company’s profitability. One less passenger/s will not make any difference to how “world class” you want to be. It has been an experience/s over time that is unforgettable.",
                    "Have not flown with Singapore Airlines for a few years. Very disappointed the food was absolutely awful. I could not even tell you what it was…it was supposed to be chicken..came in a little box & tasted like rubber. Staff seemed like it was an effort to be there. Not one smile & everything seemed to be an effort for them. I have always highly praised this airline but this trip was awful.",
                    "At the boarding gate, the passengers were kept updated that boarding would start soon. Onboard, the cabin crew members were polite. Could also hear one senior coaching a junior crew. A pity that the selection of movies was limited.",
                    "The flights were on time both in Sydney and the connecting flight in Singapore.\nThe organisation to cope with the COVID 19 restrictions while in transit  was well planned and directions easy to follow, the plane was comfortable with a reasonable selection of in flight entertainment. Crew were pleasant and helpful.",
                    "The service on Singapore Airlines Suites Class was nothing but excellent. The cabin crew was warm and friendly and, most importantly, came across as sincere and genuine. Throughout the flight, I interacted with Leading Stewardess Sharifah the most, who went all the way out to ensure we were comfortable and well taken care of. I saw her patrolling the cabin consistently to check if we needed anything(I could see her looking into the Suite), and she was always read y to assist us. She even offered to make up our bed after the breakfast run so that we could rest. When I asked if I could walk around both decks of the aircraft, Sharifah volunteered to show me around. She was very knowledgeable about the configurations in the A380 aircraft and even pointed to the best seats in each cabin class as we walked through. \n\nThe Suites Class cabin resembles the private cabins onboard sleeper trains, which gives Suites Class passengers some form of privacy. The cut holes on the cabin doors, in the shape of a flower design, somewhat reduce the privacy we got in the Suites Class cabins. There are two lavatories at the front of the aircraft catering to the six Suites Class passengers. The lavatory on the right is the bigger of the two, featuring a vanity table between the toilet and the sink.  There is plenty of space in this lavatory for passengers to change into the Lalique pyjamas provided to Suites Class passengers. The lavatory on the left was smaller but no less luxurious. Passengers using this lavatory can still find it spacious to change in and out of their pyjamas. This lavatory still provides the same amenities as the larger lavatory. \n\nNot all suites have the same size. The biggest are the foremost Suites (1A and 1F), about 5m2; the smallest (3A and 3F) are the aftmost Suites measuring 3.3m2. I occupy the middle Suite (2A) with 4m2 of real estate. Each Suite is fitted with both a chair and a bed.  The walls of the Suite were printed with floral designs that enhanced the luxurious vibe and did not come across as being too loud or over the top, consistent with the design language of the cabin. A side table sits by the entrance of the Suite. The flight attendants use this side table to place our drinks or snacks without needing to deploy the table.  The table is solid and huge, providing tons of space for Suites Class passengers.  The table can be swivelled for passengers to get in and out of the seat without stowing it away. \n\nThe seat was the first thing that caught my eye when I entered my Suite and is very comfortable. An oversized pillow is placed onto the seat to provide passengers with greater comfort, especially in reclined mode. The seat measures 35\" wide and can recline up to 45°. The calf rest of the seat can only be deployed when the seat is swivelled to face the TV or the front of the aircraft (the green light on the control panel would light up to indicate calf rests can be deployed). Swivelling of the seat is controlled electronically via the control panel built into the left side of its armrest or the tablet provided in the Suite. There are two power sockets that came fitted with USB-A charging outlets in the Suite, one at the side of the side table at the entrance of the Suite and another on the storage cubby by the window. Singapore Airlines Suites Class features a bed in the Suite on top of the comfortable seat. Singapore Airlines uses Lalique bedding for the bed. I found the bed was very sturdy, lacking in terms of comfort. The mattress padding was a tad thin and lacked cushioning. The two pillows that came with the bed were too soft for my liking. \n\nThere is no lack of storage space in the Suites Class onboard Singapore Airlines. Besides the pockets and shelving on the bulkheads and the seat, there is a small wardrobe by the door. Due to the slim design of the wardrobe, a limited amount of things can be stowed here. There is space in the wardrobe for passengers to hang their jackets. The bottom part of the wardrobe allowed me to stow away my backpack. More storage is fitted into the bulkhead of the Suite. Due to the shallow design of these cubbies, I could only use them to store smaller items. Singapore Airlines designed an open shelving space with a single leather strap beneath the cubby holes. Singapore Airlines fitted a 32\" HD touchscreen TV in the Suite. The TV can be swivelled with a touch of a button either on the seat or from the tablet to face the passengers when sitting on the seat. There are two IFE controllers in the Suite; a smaller one is stowed in the seat's armrest, which I found very intuitive to use. The other IFE controller is via tablet in the Suite.",
                    "Singapore Airlines have always been a favourite for service food and on time.however post COVID still very good service but food unacceptable terrible no taste like eating cardboard.they have lost me . things didn't get any better on the return home.maybe we should give Jetstar. a chance.",
                    "Singapore Airlines' service standards continue to be exemplary, but the vegetarian food on this flight was the worst I have had. The rice and side dishes were cold, and no beverage was offered with the meal. It's a continuation of this strange practice of dumping the special meals first, instead of serving them along with the others, so that vegetarians and other special \"mealers\" can get a drink to go with their food. The Premium Economy seats were also the worst I have experienced.",
                    "Returning home during the pandemic after living in France for two years, this could have been a difficult journey. Instead, SIA made it pleasant and easy. They provided timely communication, efficient check-in, friendly service on-board, and excellent transit facilities (in Changi airport). I would highly recommend Singapore Airlines for international travel.",
                    "My wife an I had a brilliant first leg of our trip to Christchurch New Zealand, via Singapore. We were extremely well looked after by Tricia and her colleagues, Jessie, Jun Hoo, Vincent, Cheau Li, Rishika, and Hui Qi. All of the crew were, without doubt, why we choose to fly with Singapore Airlines. We used to fly with what was a main UK airline, but service is what we pay for and we got exactly that, plus smiles and polite responses to our every wish. Thank team from SQ319. See you in 2024. Mike M",
                    "I recently travelled with Singapore Airlines from Brisbane too Zurich and have done so many times on the last 20 years. I have always been happy with the service and food provided and do not usually complain. But on my last flight I found the food offerings on the Brisbane too Singapore flight to be lacking, we were served one meal (lunch) and a couple of rounds of drinks for the entire 8 hour flight. I understand two meals may not be feasible on such a flight but in years gone by a snack or 'light refreshement' was always served a couple of hours from Singapore and vice versa. \nI also don't find using Covid a valid excuse for cutting the inflight food service as other airlines such as Emirates and Qatar and even Qantas still serve a full meal and snack on flights of similar lengths. \nI hope Singapore Airlines improves there catering offerings in the future as one meal for 8 hours is definitely not 5 stars!!!",
                    "What a wonderful experience with Singapore airlines , although the stewards were working very hard keeping me and the rest of the passengers happy nothing faced them\nWell done",
                    "Singapore Airlines 787 has reverted to a budget airline experience.  They could have packed more seats in economy if they tried to.  Food awful and served in a McDonalds type box. They have made flying in their 787s unpleasant.  Large screens but mine did not work.  Their much vaunted reputation and advertising belie an unpleasant experience. \n\nSorry but your better off on other airlines on the route we took.",
                    "I can only say the help we received from the staff at the Singapore airlines desk F.was fantastic they listened to our problem with our visas   They said don’t worry we’ll sort it and true to there word they did taking photographs helping us through the whole process  organising our flights luggage even getting us seats together couldn’t thank them enough  so patient and professional.

                    "We are frequent flyers with SIA in the route. But this time we experienced the SIA service quality having degraded substantially. Especially food quality and quantity were substantially downgraded.\nUnlike other top-level full-service airlines, we found SIA now stopped providing toy/amenity kits for kids.\n\n2-hr free wifi in the economy was good..but it seems SIA is trying to make benefit in the wrong way by increasing the price substantially and downgrading the service drastically. Additionally, unlike pre-covid now SIA started providing 25 kg check-in unless someone buys a flexi ticket (pre-covid it was 30 kg for all fare categories in this SIN-CCU-SIN route).\n\nThis was overall disappointing service compared to the earlier experience with SIA.",
                    "In the bigger scheme of things among all airlines, it provides a high level of service and offers a good product, though not outstanding. Staff service was professional and efficient but somewhat lacking in genuineness. Service, especially on the outbound, was very rushed. For example, the pre-departure hot towel was given and taken away before I could even touch it. Cabin crew can best be described as highly efficient but perfunctory. There is a high degree of helpfulness but also kind of stern. Seating was the same kind for inbound and outbound even though they were on different types of aircraft (B787 and A350). One is lucky to get flat-bed seating on a regional flight, but the seat is just uncomfortable, too narrow, and the head “wing” gets in the way and blocks the view from the window. The 3-point seatbelt was also uncomfortable. Food on the outbound was awful, even when it’s from “book the cook”. The duck was dry and pathetic looking, and tasted like it looked. On the inbound, the fish dish was excellent and succulent. I wonder if it’s from the Bangkok kitchen rather than from the Singapore kitchen. Beverages were good, with Piper Heidsieck champagne and a very good port, though the pre-takeoff champagne was served warm. There was strangely no beverage menu -- only a food menu with wine list. For the Singapore lounges, Terminal 3 lounge is renovated and expanded, and world class. Terminal 2 lounge is dated and in need of a revamp. The main issue with the Singapore lounges is the food – only mediocre local food is served. It is a real shame that there is no Western food, or other kinds of Asian cuisine such as Japanese and Middle Eastern. Singapore is not known for tasty food or fine cuisine, and the lounge food clearly reflects this. The lounge wines were very good, however; especially the 2 kinds of white. Lounge staff were rather surly. The Bangkok lounge was good enough for its purpose of being an outstation lounge. It has enough quantity and variety of seating and adequate F & B, though there are no showers. F & B on the whole – both on board and in the lounge – was one level below that of Qatar, though Singapore has better consistency in the various other aspects. Online check-in was very smooth and painless. You need not go to a counter nor get a paper boarding pass.\n\nOutbound:\nCabin service: 3/5\nMeal: 2/5\nTerminal 3 lounge in Singapore: 4/5\nTerminal 2 lounge in Singapore: 3/5\n\nInbound:\nCabin service: 4/5\nMeal: 5/5\nLounge in Bangkok: 4/5\n\nGeneral:\nOnline check-in: 5/5\nSeating: 3/5\nInflight entertainment: 4/5\nInflight beverages: 4/5",

                    "Surprisingly hard and little leg room when flat on the A380. The A350 on next leg was better. I was disappointed to be honest based on the reputation.

                    "Undertook four long-haul flights with Singapore airlines in November/December 2022.\nThe flight from London to Singapore was excellent. Attentive and courteous flight attendants plus good service. Just what one would normally expect from Singapore airlines. the next three flights were average to bad. Boarding in Changi airport was a complete scrum.  No clear differentiation of lines for business class and economy. The return flight from Singapore to London  was totally lacklustre.  Although business class was approximately one third empty the staff were lethargic at best. The only drinks offered during this 13.5 hour flight were at the two meal services.  Over the past 30 years I have travelled extensively in both business class and economy. I can mostly say that the level of service is far better in  Thai air  economy class. Come on Singapore airlines, don't rest on your laurels in this highly competitive market.",

                    "See all the previous reviews about SIA and their lack of service for vegetarian passengers. The food on SQ323 from Amsterdam was a disaster. Tried again for my daughter to get a better service for this leg. First don't try to get \"customer service\" by phone. After +2 hrs. waiting on the phone, you're just cut off (obviously common/normal). OK, you've got to go downtown to their ION office. Packed! Well, try today at check-in. My daughter was referred to the ticket office. Waiting! She had to dash off to get her flight to BKK. I waited in line and could finally explain the complaint to an agent. \n\nI share the conversation: Agent/A: Sir, your daughter already changed her meals. Me/M: Yes, she did. Her only option is either Chinese or Indian vegetarian, but not Western. So she had to choose Indian. A: But she also selected waffles for the flight to Amsterdam. M: She did because there was no other Western option. Waffles for dinner and breakfast. The \"Book the Cook\" option didn't offer an alternative either. A: Sir, she could select a vegan meal. M: Vegan is not vegetarian. A: (other agent mixed in) saying in Malay (which I happen to speak) \"refer the guy to the service phone\". M: (In Malay) is this how you treat your business class passengers? Why don't you Google vegetarian and vegan.\n\nAfter this other disappointing experience with Singapore Airlines, I left. The agent can't help you if the company doesn't offer decent alternatives for their BUSINESS CLASS passengers. If their website is one of the worst in the business, their \"customer service\" phone is perpetual busy and factually non-existent, and their focus is on non-Western passengers, don't expect their agents to be \"customer centric\" or helpful in any way.\n\nBottom line: If you are Western, and you're a vegetarian, DON'T fly with Singapore Airlines. They do everything to discourage you to fly with them. If they treat business class passengers like this, what will they do with coach passengers?!",

                    "Me and my partner have  been flying with Singapore Airlines for the last 10 years. Initially they were absolutely fantastic and faultless. Since flying after Covid the standard of the service including cleanliness of toilets and quality of the food served was poor. The vegan options were poor with no choice and all the other meals served were absolutely of the lowest quality. We were delayed 2 hours whilst sat on the plane and not  even offered refreshments. I had to pay an additional £500.00 to change my partners flight to fly back home with me due to her poor health. There was no reason in my opinion as the plane had plenty of spare seats. I would not recommend Singapore Airlines as they only care about Business class clients and those who buy there fancy Suites. Unfortunately They have lost there reputation for those in economy class flying internationally and i will not Singapore Airlines again as in my experience theres no point using an airline thats no better than any other and  a third more per ticket. I do not recommend Singapore Airlines.",
                    "Although I have written several reviews of Singapore Airlines (SIA) before, this review is the first in 3 years since the outbreak of the Covid19 pandemic as world travel had been limited and restricted since then.\n\nAs the pandemic has more or less stabilised and traveling has been resumed, I also have restarted my \"walk around the world\". And all the while, I have been flying with SIA, unless for domestic flights.\n\nSo I am sharing this recent flight where I flew in the business class of the A350-900 aircraft.\n\nFirst, the ambience was great and cosy and seat was very comfortable. I always prefer the Airbus over Boeing as the seat seemed \"larger and more comfortable\". And indeed it was!\n\nFood and drink wise, very good. I had made my order online and so the crew did not have to ask and served the food to us. They were tasty and nice and during our entire flight, crew kept on coming and asking if we required any more drinks or snacks and making sure we were \"well fed\". Kudos to the crew team, and of course they were very friendly and polite, not to mention efficient and smiles were always on their faces. \n\nAlthough the check-in and bording process were a little slow (not to blame on the airline itself but the local staff working attitudes and procedures), the service inflight was totally another story, it was outstanding!\n\nIt's a comfortable flight, and also a stable one too! Even my 80+ mum was very satisfied with the entire flight experience as she didn't like to fly.\n\nIt's good to be able to fly again and of course great to be back at the Business Class. Moving forward, in 2023, I have plans to travel more with the airlines and \"it's a great way to fly, and whose service even other airlines talk about\"!",
                    "Good flight left on time and arrived early food on board good and seem to be feed continuously  seats and space resnoble so no complaints",
                    "Current aircraft used undersized and is in desperate need of upgrade. One set of toilets at rear of cabin for whole plane for a 7 hour flight is not sufficient. Seats are now crammed together so few people actually have enough leg room. Seats also pushed to side of aircraft to allow for wider aisle! Food was mediocre. White wine was served warm. Service on this flight was good but on Frankfurt to Singapore flight in premium economy was terrible. Poor explanation of food choices, rubbish not collected, requests forgotten, parts of seat falling off and being masked back into place. I was keeping an eye out for an older gentleman sitting nearby, the attendant just plonked down hot food on top of other items on tray. I had rubbish in my hands and was told to hold on to it even I had no where to put it. Just woeful.",
                    "This was the worst flying experience we have ever had. It started with a chaotic and uncontrolled boarding at the Changi Airport. There was absolutely no checking of the tickets or seating. Boarding was more like a stampede. Flight was delayed for around half an hour for a technical reason. In a Premium Economy class for dinner we were only served with a slice of soggy, tasteless, stuck to a paper cardboard, pizza. After that, during night, there was no service whatsoever. We were sitting in the first raw, on the side, unfortunately right next to the storage compartment that the crew members were constantly using, mostly for their own personal things. Door opening and closing, read banging, was going on for the whole night. Seats were uncomfortable, making sleeping difficult and hardly any better than in Economy Class. Throughout the night it was very cold and the given thin blankets were rather useless. There was no free wifi also.\nFor breakfast there were 2 choices of food and both were of very poor quality. Neither for dinner nor breakfast did we have cloth napkins.\nOn disembark from the airplane we were directed towards Economy door.\nSummary: Avoid Premium Economy on Singapore Airlines at all cost, do not waste your money.\nOverall, we found flight crew unfriendly.\n",
                    "Having flown with this carrier in the past, in premium economy, I was a little disappointed with the seating this time. I feel they have dropped the ball in premium economy seats, as I felt that the seats were not as roomy as my previous experience. It was also irritating that there were no toilets in the premium economy section, and we had to walk back through economy to use the toilets, and 1 of them was out of service - bit of a nuisance on a long haul flight. These are only minor issues, I know, but I specifically selected Singapore airlines based on my previous experience with them, and I was let down. The staff were all friendly and attentive but I’m Not sure that I would choose them again in premium economy",
                    "Fly from KL to NYC,the Airlines was very good!\n1.The food was quite good\n2.The seat was comfortable like Qatar airways!\n3.The entertainment was really amazing!\n4.The floor was really clean,not like Malaysia Airlines!\n5.The cabin crew was really kind,honest and beautiful!\n6.The costumers service was excellent!",
                    "Perth to Hanoi via Singapore return in economy seats for 4 adults. Paid an eye watering amount for 4 tickets one of whom required extra lounge room ($400AU extra for al 4 flights).\nAll4 flights were on time, boarding was explained and staff enforced the correct process. \nOn two of the four flights the stewards moved inappropriate passengers from the emergency exit (both with significant mobility issues) . Thank fully on the flights there were seats spare in the bulk head that they were able to move to.\nAs someone with a significant fear of flying I was pleased that on all four flights the pilots introduced themselves, their co-pilot and the head steward before we began moving. \n3/4 planes were very clean and the bathrooms were kept tidy for all flights. The return flight from Hanoi to Singapore my tray table was covered in spilt coffee and had obviously not been cleaned - the plane had arrived late from Singapore and given the return flight was like a roller coaster I could understand what happened.\nFood - the smaller meals (\"new' lunch box style)  on the Singapore to Hanoi route were actually far tastier than the full meal option on the longer flight. The vegetarian in our group was very happy with their meals.\nA good quality post travel covid experience",
                    "Absolutely amazing to travel with. I have a severe nut allergy and singapore airlines was the only company that happily provided me with nut free meals and snacks. The staff were kind and attentive and made me feel very comfortable. There was a huge range of activities to do inboard such as games, music, TV shows and movies. Would 100% travel with them again.",
                    "This was the first post covid trip after a long hiatus and i was very excited. The airport experience was a bit different with no express lanes to breeze through security and immigration but it didn't matter I was just happy to smell the jet fuel again.The lounge in Sydney was just right. \nBoarding was a bit hectic but once on board and seated in 24A I was very happy.\nThe service was as expected, brilliant as was the food and all over comfort.\nBoarding again in December.",
                    "I will give no star for Singapore airlines if you TripAdvisor has no star for rating. Because I had a terrible experience from Singapore Airlines at DPS (Bali). They have no rule for getting the line. I pay extra for my ticket because I don’t want to wait and getting lines with economy tickets, BUT the coworkers of Singapore airlines at DPS airport don’t care about what I pay extra for. Thus, they let economy passengers who has child go to the airplane before me, doesn’t matter I getting the lines at business lines before them.\nFirstly, I don’t know why economy passengers who has children can go before me event I pay extra for business tickets. The economy passengers has only 1 child, but they go with 10 adult from 30 to 50 years old. OMG child looks a like an express ticket, that has more powerful than business and first class tickets. \nSecondly, if you guys rule can let them go with business lines, so they need to getting the line right? The rude things from Singapore airlines coworkers is they let those rude people skip the line and go before business and first class lines. That is so mean and rude service. \nThird, in the airplane one of passenger has coughed like 30 minutes, that he couldn’t stop. The cabin crew didn’t come to ask him or help him at all. They should tell him goes to the bathroom or give him hot water or at least try to help him, but they didn’t do that. \nFinally, I will give Singapore Airlines one star for rating. I will not recommend to go with this company. Their service very terrible. If you guy don’t believe me, you can try and will see what happens at DPS Bali airport. \nGood luck!",
                    "I have used Singapore Airlines several times in the past and they have always been V. Good, BUT this recent trip I had in Aug: 2022, was Horrible and disgraceful , The only positive on our return trip was the flight from Phuket to Singapore. Then things deteriorated at an alarming rate, \n              1 . I asked for wheel chair assistance, NONE AVAILABLE.\n              2. I asked for a forward zone seat, = we were given the row before the last from the back of the aircraft, Row , 43.\n              3.   I requested a centre isle seat , = we were given a side window seat, which meant we had to get up every time the other passenger wanted to go to the washroom.\n             4. A young Man guided us to where we had to go through a security check, there was 300 other passengers in the queue , SO, rightly so, he took us to the front of the queue, because I was an assisted passenger with a Yellow sticker,  highlighting that fact, But we were spoken to very rudely by the person in charge and told to go to the back of the queue, this would have meant standing in the queue for almost an hour because it was ridiculously slow and unorganised.\nOther passengers who saw this offered us to come into the queue near the front.\n         5. Eventually we got on the aircraft , and after travelling almost 11 hours (which\n includes  waiting in airports ) we were looking forward to a cool drink and something to eat,  FIVE HOURS LATER, they started what can only be called the breakfast service, Remember we are at the back of the aircraft, and it took them 40 minutes to get to us.\n        6. WHAT WE WERE GIVEN WAS ABSOLUTE SLOP, WHICH I WOULD NOT GIVE TO MY DOG.\n          Needless to say the last leg was operated by SCOOT, ( unknown to us ) and it was an absolute disgrace.\n           Singapore Airlines needs to up their game , GET RID of Scoot, otherwise according to the last sixty reviews ,which I have read , they will go down the Tubes, and no one will fly with them.",
                    "Took a midnight flight from Singapore to Sydney with my pregnant wife. During the flight, the man in front of us was very aggressive for some reason and kept on reclining his chair and rocking it to annoy my wife who was sitting behind him. As my wife preferred an aisle seat, we asked if they flight attendants could speak to the man or switch my wife's seat with someone. They attendants said that because the man was so aggressive, there was nothing they could do. So I gave my wife the middle seat instead and which made her feel claustrophobic. I asked the attendants again if they could switch her seat but because it was a fully booked flight, there was nothing that they could do. I am quite disappointed with Singapore Air because we had heard such great reviews about their service.\n\nI also contacted Singapore Air directly via phone, email and web form - all of which have been ignored.",
                    "Passengers aboard, a 90 minute on tarmak flight delay, no explanation.  No A/C.\nBaggage mix up, whisked away to security check of someone else's luggage. \nSeat assignments not honored. Airbus 350, 1\" knee to seat back clearance for 5'11\", which is ZERO when forward seat is reclined. Cabin crew refused to ask the forward seat to allow clearance, or change seating (many unoccupied available). Chicken dinner actually mac and cheese with a 1\"x2\" piece if cold chicken on cold slaw. Rude, inattentive  cabin crew throughout entire flight. 55yrs. of flying, the absolute worst start to finish.  ",
                    "Upgraded from premium economy to business class (1st time ever). My partner and I loved it from beginning to the end. The food was amazing and the cabin crew were unbelievably friendly and welcoming. We usually fly premium and always enjoy that experience,  but this was definitely a step up with the lovely spacious seats. Will definitely go business class again....need to start saving",
                    "Flew premium economy (PE) on world's two longest flights - SIN-JFK; EWR-SIN. SQ needs to do more on these long flights to make it comfortable for non-business class passengers. \n\nPros:\n- The PE seat\n- Entertainment system \n\nCons:\n- Food was very very poor (hit or miss main plus a likely miss salad and a hard bed roll - and only two of those on a 18.5 hour flight)\n- Service is efficient but not particularly friendly; crew doesn't pass by that often through the flight\n- On one leg, seat was not properly cleaned so had to ask crew member for tissues etc to wipe spilled coffee and crumbs",
                    "Our flight with Singapore Airlines departed on time, arrived on time into Singapore with a 50 min transit, to change to flight SQ 306, to continue through to London. Every facet of our travel (check-in confirmation, baggage check-in, travel, all meals, flight x2, to picking up our 4 suitcases was without any issues arising) with the airline was smooth without any issues. All staff were excellent and dealt with full flights with the 1st flight on an Airbus A350, with the 2nd flight on a Boeing 777-300, that arrived about 30 min's early into Heathrow. Would we ever travel with another airline our of Australia. the easy answer is, 'NO'.",
                    "The Singapore airlines service we experienced was exceptional on our recent trip from Brisbane Australia to the Maldives. I will find it hard to fly any other airline after our experience. Normally we go business but decided to break flight up and stay a night in Singapore & checked our bags through to Male !\nBest thing was to fly through the day & get a good sleep then head off following morning - we landed in Male refreshed ready for our Island adventures !! Flying on the afternoon flight with great headsets and exit row and fab movies with a stop over @ the Crown attached to the airport in Singapore was just the best and I have to say the biggest thank you all the air hostesses and especially to - FSS Ismar Nurlinda Binte Omar (Linda ) on SQ 431 MLE- SIN on 30/08/23 who went above and beyond giving us business class care in our economy seats!! ♥️🙏🏼",
                    "Just completed the 18 hour+ flight from Newark International Airport to Singapore. I have travelled from the States to Singapore many times, but have previously flown via United from Newark to San Francisco, and then SFO to Singapore. I decided to try the nonstop flight just to have the experience. Overall, it was as good as an 18- hour flight can be. Sitting in business class with the flat-bed seats was certainly worth the cost. The food was delicious and the movie selection was outstanding. I watched five movies (all recent releases), and as a result was throughly entertained for the first 9-10 hours of the flight. When I finally decided to go horizontal, the flight attendant helped to convert the seat into a bed and I was reasonably comfortable; my only complaint is that the flat bed configuration requires that you sleep on an angle, and there isn't a lot of room to maneuver on the bed. When you want to switch positions, you feel like you are on a rotisserie. However, the plus factors greatly outweigh the inconvenience of not being able to truly sleep comfortably when you are a very tall person. I also like the fact that the flight arrives into Singapore about 5:00pm, and during the summer--this is a plus (at least for me), since it is still daylight in Singapore and I felt that I had a few hours to be active before I crashed.  I don't think I will ever say that I am looking forward to a 18-hour nonstop flight, but if you have to fly from the US east coast to Singapore, it is the best way to go.",
                    "It's been 3 years since we were able to fly, due to COVID restrictions in Australia.  On this occasion we flew from Sydney on SQ222 (A380) to Singapore. After a layover of less than 3 hours we flew on SQ322 (A380) to London, with both flights in Business class.  With flights relatively full, not mach has changed since 2019, with all Singapore Airlines staff we encountered supplying exceptional service from our check-in at Sydney to leaving our flight in London.  Both flights left on time and both arrived early into Singapore and Heathrow, London, with all bags arriving with us. Our pre-ordered meals were excellent during both flights.",
                    "We flew Sydney to Copenhagen via  Singapore in Premium Economy . We paid for extra leg room seats to provide extra comfort to stretch out and this was worthwhile. Premium Economy  seats are definitely wider and more comfortable than economy although still somewhat lacking in comfort padding. Having the option of book the cook where one can choose pre described dishes in advance is an advantage. I did feel that the Book the cook choices were somewhat limited  although they were tasty and adequate. \nService was very good - attentive, polite  and efficient.  Crew came through many times with water through the flight not just  at set meal times and they were very responsive to calls in between.The planes were well maintained and clean and the toilets appeared to be serviced during the flight.   Having to walk through several sections to get to the toilets in economy was a nuisance but there seemed to be adequate facilities for a full flight. \nThere is a general feeling that the crew are working together and information provided from the cockpit was efficient and informative. \nAll in All we were satisfied with Singapore Airlines and would continue to use it as our preferred airline.\nI FIND THE 5 STAR RATING BELOW RESTRICTIVE.  I WOULD PREFER TO RANK GOOD not AVERAGE OR VERY GOOD",
                    "Boarding didn't took long as on other airlines. There was a lot of legroom and seat was pretty confy too. I'm impressed with Singapore airlines and i am sure i will fly with them again!",
                    "I want mention that I am really Impressed by Service Offered by Singapore Airlines. On August 15th, I had to book Flights from my Parents from Delhi to JFK in emergency when Emirates Cancelled flight (Horrible Airlines) & offered no support on Rebooking.\n\nSingapore Airlines Call Center staff was awesome. They quickly accommodated wheelchair and meal request at very short notice. My Parents informed me that they have never seen in their 40 year travel history such a friendly & caring staff. Flight from Delhi to Singapore was very very good. Also Flight from Singapore to JFK is the Longest. My Parents informed that Crew was so good and they took care of them So well. I am now getting tempted to Fly Singapore Airlines during my Next travel.",
                    "This flight was an absolute nightmare. Not only were the people who originally had pre-booked meals (which by the way their website did not allow me to do) were serviced almost immediately while the rest of us had to wait more than an hour for our meals. My wife's meal was already opened - and cold! The air hostesses also seem to spent more time with clients with babies than on the rest of us. Breakfast on the morning was also a disaster - the choices we were given were obviously not for a breakfast! ",
                    "I'm 6ft 1 and you would need to be contortionist to get comfortable on these seats.  Whether reclining or as a bed they are so uncomfortable it's not even funny. You have to lay diagonally across them and stick your feet in a small hole, then every time you turn you nearly break your ankles.  On top of that the seats are quite hard.\nMy wife is 5ft 4 and she thought the same.\nI feel like I have been ripped off!\nThey don't even compare to the business class seats on Air New Zealand or Cathay Pacific.",
                    "On a recent trip through Asia, my wife and I found the service was the standout. In some sectors flights were marginally delayed though understanding this is beyond the airlines control. Luggage tuned up every time and not overly beaten around. The food was good, some far better than other meals and the drinks selection whilst good, may need to expand, which I would say will as the world reopens.",
                    "As I was flying from Tokyo to London, I actually took four flights in May. There is a lot I love about Singapore Airlines, but it really is dependant upon where you are sitting.\nOn my first flight from Tokyo to Singapore, I was lucky to book a bulkhead seat. Very comfortable and I got some sleep. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to book a bulkhead seat for the lengthier trip from Singapore to London. I was in the last row of an economy cabin and although I was lucky there was no one next to me, I felt very penned in spite of the plane being an A380 - especially when the passenger in front of me reclined. I have put on a bit of weight recently - that could be why, but I didn't feel that way a few months ago when I flew with Emirates on an A380. On the plus side, the cabin crew was lovely, the entertainment system was excellent and I chose the vegetarian Indian option - everything was very tasty.\n\nOn my way back, I think I hit the jackpot! I was in the second row of economy with the no bulkhead seat in front of me. No one was in the row beside me and I slept very well. As it was a late night flight I opted for no dinner - even so the the cabin attendants were very attentive and made sure that I wasn't hungry and was well hydrated. One of the best flights ever.\n\nUnfortunately, the trip from Singapore to Tokyo felt - again - very cramped. I was very hungry by that stage and was surprised that on a seven hour flight, there was only one meal served - which was quite later on into the flight. A snack of some kind would have been very welcome.\n\nIf I can make sure I get a bulkhead seat or fly in Premium Economy I would definitely use Singapore Airlines again. Although the stopover time in Singapore was very long, the flights were very reasonably priced. A bit of a mixed bag but the service was universally good.\n\nBut if my budget stretches I may choose Emirates next time I fly.",
                    "This was probably one of worst experiences of a commercial airline. I heard and read such good reviews I was looking forward to flying with them. A 13 1/2 hour flight, a daytime flight, no sooner we had taken off, they wanted the window shutters down and dimmed the lights- remember that this was a daytime flight. They wanted everyone to sleep so they wouldn’t have to give any service. We asked for a bottle of water, none available just given half a plastic glass of water out of the tank. Food was awful and no snacks offered. We had to keep asking for water or juice to try to keep dehydrated. Only went to use the bathroom once……. Floor soaking wet, toilet not flushing fully and sink blocked (half full of water). Getting off the flight we both had bagging headaches and had to buy water to rehydrate. I have contacted Singapore airlines for them to comment but it’s been 11 days and nothing. Please avoid them as it is apparent that their service has been compromised",

The flight was okay, definitely not the same as when I’ve travelled with them before, very disappointing ",

Again 4 people one wheelchair. Apart from this rather than give us the required information they had us running the length of terminal 3 in Singapore dint bother telling us it was a long hike from where we get off the sky train to the gate and that the lounge was actually near where we got off the sky train.\nAs for the business class seats I have never had more uncomfortable seats in my life it’s like trying to sleep on a concrete slab.\nI don’t know how they got Airline of the year!

                    "The last time I flew with Singapore Airlines (economy) was pre covid in March 2020.  The service has changed quite a bit since the last time I flew with Singapore.  No amenity pack on your chair with your pillow and blanket, no printed menu, no snacks throughout the flight, limited water, is a shame as it is the little touches that give an airline the edge over others.  That said Singapore is still the best value for the route I was taking.  As we all know flying economy is not the most comfortable but the seats on the plane were pretty comfy and have a good incline when sleeping. I bought a foot hammock for the flight to Singapore and I have to say an absolute game changer, well worth taking next time you do long haul. The staff on the plane where friendly and helpful on all four of my flights and the food that I did have was good.  I had a 50 minute turn around in Singapore to and from Bali and whilst that does not sound a lot it is plenty of time. I booked forward seats for my turnaround flights to ensure I got off the plane quickly.   All in all a different experience from last time but still good.",

Inconsistent Covid management plan across various sectors.\n5. Not worth the money.",

Thanks to her engagement, we changed seats and travel was more comfortable because the middle seat was free. \n\nTime of service speed was above our expectations. Kavitha cared for me very much, for example if my drinks were over, she asked if I wanted more. Her smile was a big additional advantage to long travel. She also asked during the journey how I felt and If I did not need something. When I felt sleepy, she gave sleep mask and earplugs, and asked me if I want additional blanket and pillow. \n\nThanks to her and all rest cabin crew, the flight passed with amazing ambiance. After landing, she gave nice gift playing cards. \n\nI hope that soon I will have chance to travel with Singapore Airlines. Without doubts, I can say that flight on board with Kavitha is unusual experience. \n\nGreat if Singapore Airlines could offer direct flights in future to Poland.",
                    "Overall, extremely pleased as always with Singapore Airlines. The entire experience was effortless, and a big thank you to the staff at Singapore Airlines, they were amazing. Thanks again.",
                    "In September 2022 we flew Premium Economy on SIA from Singapore to London. While it was a much more comfortable flight than our previous flight in Economy a few days before, the main thing we noticed was the surliness of the staff and their poor attitude towards the Caucasian passengers. They were friendly enough to their fellow Asians. We experienced exactly the same on our earlier flight in Economy. The Premium Economy seats were great, very comfortable with good leg room and footrests. There was a bottle of water in the pocket. However, apart from the comfort, there was nothing to set Premium Economy apart from Economy. For breakfast they brought us the Economy class food, and simply swapped the bun with a croissant. For a later meal, it was the Economy food again with no wine choice (apart from simply red or white from bottles already opened in Economy). They served Economy first. They seemed to be the same stewardesses. The restrooms were shared with Economy. We had no welcome drink, no little tablecloths, socks or eye masks, the little touches one would have expected in Premium Economy. Just as a comparison with another airline’s Premium Economy ... in September we also flew on a Canadian airline called Westjet. There were 2 flight attendants (Sarah and Paula) who were amazing. They greeted us personally and warmly, by name, and introduced themselves, assuring us we would be looked after, and we were. They actually made us feel as though we were the only people in Premium Economy, whereas in fact it was full! We were offered a pre-flight drink. We were offered a post-take-off drink. They took our orders for our wine selection for dinner. Out came white linen tablecloths. The trays that came were nice, the food was delicious. The warm and friendly service continued throughout the flight. Moreover, Premium Economy had its own restrooms. The whole flight was a wonderful experience. Westjet is a small Canadian airline, Singapore is a huge international airline, yet they fell short badly. Apart from the comfortable seats in Premium Economy on SIA it was not worth the extra money. We hope SIA will take a leaf out of Westjet’s book and make more of an effort to make their Premium Economy passengers feel just a little bit special.",
                    "I have a mixed review for SIA. The inflight service was excellent and the staff on the both to and from Kuala Lumpur were excellent. However, the customer service in Changi is terrible. Our flight from Kuala Lumpur to Singapore was delayed by 50 minutes and SIA had changed their schedule, so we had a 10 hour stop-over at Changi. Our request for a meal vopucher or the use of a lougnge was refused. Apparently SIA no longer provides meal vouchers. This came as a bit of a shock to us as we have been flying with SIA since 2008, sans the Covid years, and they were well known for their customer service then. Not anymore.",
                    "Not sure what all the hype is about with this airline. It was a little bit better than Thai Airways.",
                    "The Pro's\nThe width of the lie flat beds\nThe service (except for last time)\nThe showers in SG\n\nThe Con's\nThe price\nRebooking a flight is always a nightmare.\nThe Business fares come in Lite, Std and Flexi. If you want to rebook on Lite it is virtually impossible. I checked for 3 weeks (no flights fot Lite, and only 1 for std!) I regard it as a con. $4k pp to change!\n\nWe have flown with SG Air for 15 years, but are trying someone new, and will never fly again with them.",
                    "Flew Singapore Airlines from JFK to Jakarta, Indonesia.  Had 1 connection in Singapore.  I love flying Singapore Airlines.  I flew them 2 years before on my Thailand trip (going and coming back).  I flew on the A350-900 from JFK to Singapore and the 777-300ER from Singapore to Jakarta.  \n\nCustomer service is always great with SQ. No issues in trying to get ahold of someone by the phone.  I booked business class seats using my credit card points.  I transfered those points directly to Singapore Airlines.  It's always better to book direct with airlines especially in these COVID times.  Very easy to check in using the Singapore Airlines app.  Dropping off bags at JFK was easy breezy as well.  It's just highly efficient process with SQ.\n\nI sat in larger cabin of business class and I had the entire area to myself (You will see in pics) from JFK to SIN.  I spent most of the flight watching movies and drinking champagne.  Flight attendants were very responsive and my champagne glass was never empty.  I love my bulkhead seats on SQ and thats where I sat for both legs.  I would say that Singapore Airlines is my favorite airlines.  I've only flown international business and international first class with them. Food was pretty good too and I thought the COVID service cuts were minimal considering other airlines had dramatic changes with their business class service.  There was definitely enough space so I had two seats on my first leg.  One I used for a flat bed to sleep and the other was when I was awake and lounging/drinking champagne.  The plane was a little more full from Singapore to Jakarta, but that was great flight too. \n\nThe flight attendants on both legs were very friendly and very attentive.  I highly recommend flying on Singapore airlines, especially in their business/first class cabins.",
                    "Wow! Singapore Airlines you do not disappoint!\n\nEverything was a masterclass in service. We love everything, The 'book the cook' is a novelty. I wish they provided pyjamas as it will make the sleep experience better and more luxurious. \n\nIf we are becoming picky, they need to make sure their cabin manager greets the guests in their seats. I would not have noticed this but the Manila to Singapore and Singapore to Manila leg did this consistently. It was amazing! It was a pretty full flight but the manager took his time to thank each guest and welcome us one by one! This is a whole new level! I wished I remembered his name because he deserved to be praised. However, the Singapore to Auckland cabin manager did not do this so I think this really depends on the manager on board. I think it brings personalisation to a whole new world if they did it on the Singapore to Auckland leg, which by the way is a longer flight.\n\nYou have made us loyal customers.",
                    "Every time I fly on Singapore Airlines my experience is excellent. \n\nThe quality of service, food, entertainment system, & cleanliness all, in my experience, make it the best airline in the world.",
                    "I am 5ft 11, l had 13 hrs of discomfort guy in front reclined so had 12 inches from my eyes to the entertainment screen so l had to recline, l am not fat, table tray touching my stomach, food average at best, wow 1 inch of red wine in plastic cup, can't say a good experience",
                    "Imagine paying for a fine meal at a 5-star restaurant: A perfectly cooked Rib-eye steak and fine wine as a 5-piece string band quietly plays classical music.  Then, for dessert, pastry from a vending machine.  That's how we felt.\n\nSix of the seven legs of our round-trip to Philippines were on SIA aircraft.  Nice meals/snacks/beverages, in-seat entertainment--even on their smaller planes. One leg was on their low-cost partner, Scoot (the Spirit Airlines of Asia).  It's OK for what it is--The staff was extremely friendly, and we felt safe on their aircraft.,, But we paid for SAI.\n\nThe Scoot leg aside, we had a wonderful experience. The meals, even in Economy, are top-notch. The seats were comfortable, in-flight entertainment was excellent and we can't say enough good things about the flight attendants and gate staff.  SIA will be our 1st choice on future trips to Asia, provided there is no Scoot-operated leg.",
                    "SQ is my go to airline for regular travel between Australia and Europe. \nThis leg we flew Airbus A350 (6 years old) Which was fully booked. Row 54 E&F (middle seats). These are always a good choice as you only have to let one person out when they need to go to the WC. \nThe seats are actually very comfy for the 14 hour flight. Once fully reclined my legs could go fully stretched out under the seat in front. \nThe IFE is excellent with so much to choose from. Once set up, it can remember what you were watching for the next onward flight. \nThe service was pretty good. A nutty snack and a drink offered soon once airborne followed by a meal service and another drink with the meal. \n\nPlenty of snacks on offer between meal service (at a request) and also amenity kits (toothbrush, socks, eye mask etc) are available on request. \nPillow and blanket were issued to each seat. ",
                    "I'd heard many good things about Singapore Airlines so was looking forward to travelling with them but was sadly disappointed. We flew economy in a 777 and although we paid for extra leg room it still felt very cramped. The seat was so uncomfortable, the noisyest flight I can recall ment there was no chance of being able to grab a couple of hours sleep but the worst thing for me was the entertainment screen was not working despite 2 resets I was left staring at the bulkhead for 13 and a half hours. The lead stewardess took my E mail address and promised compensation for the broken screen but a week on an I've heard nothing from them. Hardly one of the world's best airlines I'm afraid.",
                    "The planes ticket were oversold even when we paid for a reserved seat. Water leaked for the ceiling too. The worse thing is they told us they are gonna give us a free upgrade but we have to fly on a different day and we still had to pay the premium economy instead of not paying because we already payed.",
                    "Is it just me, or has the menu on Singapore Airlines  gone down hill since Covid. I have travelled with Singapore Airlines several times since the reopening after covid and have noticed there food has dropped in quality big time. There seems to be a lot of cheap flavourless pasta dishes served in cardboard boxes. This morning I had the choice of only a herring pasta dish for breakfast, as all the scrambled egg dishes had gone. \n\nWho eats herring pasta for breakfast?\n\nA lot of there food seems not much better then Scoot Airlines.\n On one flight I wasn't even offered a drink with my meal and had to ask for one.\n\nOther then that I found them to still be ok with everything else. The service in other way's seems to still be of a high standard.",

Seats would have been ok for smaller size passengers. At least, on this occasion we were allocated adjoining seats. Food service was a shocker, disorganised  and with the vlast three rows Port side being served after the captain had announced that the cabin should be prepared for landing. We thought that SQ726, Singapore to Phuket was poor, this flight was decidedly worse. The one positive, it was a safe flight.",
                    "4th July 2023\n\nAs we boarded The flight from Delhi to Singapore, we were told that all the seats of Business Class the Seat power is not working.

                    "No help what so ever, booked business no meals catered for me. Contacted them tens of times no assistance, no number to call localy in my area.

                    "To start with the usual bits, nice comfy seats, decent leg room for economy, good entertainment (plenty to occupy you for weeks rather than hours) and the food was good.\nThe real wow factor was from our cabin crew: (we got names) Luqman, Eonji, Johaniy, you were brilliant. Liq overheard me make a comment to my wife as we were seating about it being our honeymoon and that was it. We were treated like royalty the entire flight. Lee kept topping us up with complimentary champagne and gave us any extra freebee bits he could get his hands on. The entire crew were attentive the entire flight without being too much. Really friendly, polite and generally very nice people.\nAnd although we got the extra bits we saw them looking after every passenger the same way. Amazing airline and amazing service.\n\nThank you, you got our amazing honeymoon off to the perfect start",

                    "An absolutely fabulous airline. From staff at the check-in to staff on-board the level of service was absolutely excellent. Singapore Airlines are now my favourite airline for long haul",
                    "I flew the older interior A380 business class from Hong Kong to Singapore.\nThe seats in business on tis aircraft are probably the widest seats in business class.\nThere is a specific business class chick in counters and the staff are friendly and efficient.\n\nThe seats are in a 1-2-1 configuration each of the seat colors alternate from a tan to a darker color upholstery and they have a 55 inch pitch and a head rest that hangs over the back of teh seat with straps. The seat converts into a fully lie flat bed\n The seat controls are built into the side of the armrest area.\n\nThe cabin crew were very friendly and offered great in flight service which Singapore Airlines is well known for. The inflight service is excellent. The business suite itself offers plenty of space except the leg room cubby is angled and so not such a good design compared to others as you then have to sit or lie on an angle in the seat to stretch out with Singapore Airlines having such wide seats that isnt a problem but I would like to experience their new modern business suites to see what improvements they have made.\n\nThey provided noise cancelling airphones but there was no amenity kit provided on this short haul trip, which is common throughout most airlines but it does make you feel you have missed out on something, as amenity kits should be provided for all business class flights.\n\nThis was a day flight and the food and service were really good and it was an enjoyable flight",
                    "I booked premium economy as I wanted more leg room and a foot and calf rest. I have a disability and need to be comfortable. Staff were excellent on boarding and I was shown to my seat. Leg room was good and seat seemed comfortable. However there is nothing premium about premium economy. After takeoff we were given a snack, but nothing to drink. I asked if I could have a drink and was advised that drinks would be offered later. Why would I want to eat a snack with nothing to drink. I waited and waited. There was no bottle of water in the seating area which should have been there. After 1 hr and 20 mins finally it looked like drinks were being offered. Juice or water only. Me and my husband were missed out. We thought they would realise so waited patiently. Staff had got to economy when I got up and asked if I could have a drink as we had been missed. After waiting nearly 2hrs we finally got a drink of orange juice. Another round of drinks was offered later again juice/water tea or coffee. After nearly 5 hrs we were again offered juice or water. I asked for wine by that stage as sick of juice. To the staff members credit he got it for me. Dinner was offered with a bottle of water only. Once the trays where cleared about finally the drinks trolley with champagne was offered. My seat did not recline correctly and my TV froze twice. The staff are all lovely but there is nothing premium about premium economy. Not enough staff and very slow service. They clearly do not want to offer more than 1 alcoholic drink on an 8hr flight. The seat eventually reclined with the help of staff and was comfortable. Will never pay the cost for premium economy. As no premium food, service , and dirty toilets. The foot rest is poor and the calf rest only very minimally offers support. Emirates premium economy if far superior.",
                    "My first post-COVID Singapore flight and I was not disappointed.  Itinerary: SQ21 EWR-SIN, SQ138 SIN-PEN, SQ137 PEN-SIN & SQ22 SIN-EWR.  Crew aboard all the flights were wonderful:  always smiling, super efficient, willing to please, and calling me by my name.  Food service was very good, although the wine selection is not as good as it used to be.  Enjoyed the availability of hot snacks between meal times.  Extremely impressed that they could serve a full dinner during the short flight between SIN & PEN; it didn't feel rushed at all. Very good selection of movies and TV. Seat was comfortable, although the need to change the setup between seat and bed is a little awkward.  Also, the table is right where the armrest should be, so my elbow kept on popping up the table.\n\nThe only negative element was the agent at Penang airport.  Not knowledgeable, kept challenging my checking in case of wine.  Also, no longer keep fresh orchids in bathrooms (plastic on one flight, none on others).",
                    "Our experience started from the ground staff checking us in at Singapore. When he realized we were two of us, we were shifted to the 2 window seats to give us a little privacy.\nOn board we received exactly what we had pre-booked from Book the Cook. The salad would have been tastier if a dressing had been provided. We were on an extra long 18-hour flight and what really impressed us was that there was always someone to quickly attend to our needs. We were pleasantly surprised especially by Julian whom I never saw sitting down. The hot chocolate was very refreshing.\nA suggestion - Cream crackers or plain Marie biscuits instead of the snacks that were offered.\n\nOverall it was the entire cabin crew, and I would make a special mention of Julian and Daniel, who made a difference to our experience.",

                    "Just the perfect experience, and in my favourite aircraft (A350)! If something could be said that maybe not all like is that the \"style\" of the interior design of SA might become a bit all-too-classic, thereby dated. But this is just a visual thing and let's not discuss about colours and so! And, indeed, with a set-up that 4 seats (1-2-1) over the width of the aircraft are present as compared with the 6 seats (2-2-2) for the same class and aircraft with e.g., Lufthansa, it is more than clear that the privacy space and the size of the bed for the night is EXCELLENT!",
                    "Service was impeccable: my wife had hurt her knee not long before we flew and found walking any distance difficult.  Before we even reached the check-in/baggage-drop desk, SIA had offered to get her assistance.  This carried her right to the plane's door - where a squad of stewardesses positively fought over who would help her onto the plane itself.  And then the same on arrival.  Outstanding customer care.\nFood was good.  Music choice was not quite as wide as I expected but ok: the headphones were good.  (Can't comment on film choices.)\nBusiness flat bed - well, it's true that it lies flat, but you end up lying diagonally and your feet are in a little cubby-hole.  I had several bouts of cramp and can't describe it as comfortable, although admittedly this 777 was better than the A380 on the return flight, which was just simply uncomfortable - far too firm, as a seat and a bed.

                    "Used to fly SQ for SIN-JPN route often prior to pandemic, but every aspect of the flight quality level has dropped significantly after the pandemic. Not asking for more than what economy class should be, but upset to see the economy class standard is no longer the same as before. \n\nLike many passengers have reviewed, no more hot towel service, a few items taken off the meal tray and reduced baggage allowance. During a recent flight back from Osaka-KIX, the meal tray really look embarrassing for a top notch airline. It was Japanese curry rice which consist of 4 very small pieces of beef cubes, 3 small cubes of potato and 2 slices of carrot, with plenty of gravy on top of an onigiri sized rice; there is a bun with butter, a packet of biscuit with cheese spread and ice cream. If cost is an issue, I guess just provide each passenger a packet of Hainan chicken rice or Nasi Lemak, which probably will look more presentable and representative of SG.",

From takeoff the flight crew was disorganized and struggling.  The first meal out of SYD was average, the curry was good but the flat bread was very thick and cold – inedible.  Drinks were chaotic at best and very slow all the time. The stewardess managed to spill my second glass of water all over my right side!  She did apologize.\nThe second meal, a snack would be a kind description, was totally inedible.  The cold outer covering ‘bread?’ was really dense, the filling indeterminate and the taste disgusting.

                    "Our first time on SIA. LHR to Phuket return via Singapore. It was a lot of flying time, going so far past Phuket, but the onboard experience was pretty good for Economy, A380 out, A350 back. The cabin crew, food, drink and entertainment systems were all excellent. So why are we unlikely ever to fly SIA again? They cancelled our return flight from Phuket (well before we flew). We were then faced with a 14 hour overnight wait in Changi airport. We had booked an expensive room in the T1 Aerotel but canclled it when friends said the rooms are freezing and they don't bother to open their main attraction, a rooftop pool, until the afternoon. When we arrived at Changi the night before our London flight, cutting short our Khao Lak oliday, we were incensed to see that SIA had much earlier LHR flights they could have switched us to, leaving at 01:15 (perfect) and 09:00 (much better than our afternoon flight). But not only had they not bothered to do that, they were impossible to contact, telling us to go via our travel company! That is bad on so many levels when it was SIA who had deliberately (or incompetently) failed to switch us to a much more convenient LHR flight. Our 14 hours overnight was hell.  We were lucky and got two recliners in the T2 Snooze Lounge. But the airport authorities decided that 3am would be a good time to wake up the snooze lounge with incredibly loud drilling and banging directly above. When that stopped around 5am the kitchen staff in the adjacent Ambassador Hotel propped open the fire escape door betweem them and the Snooze Lounge and keep everyone there awake until dawn. So no SIA, we will never forget the way you casually inflicted a gruelling 34 hour door to dor endurance test on a couple in their 70s. And certainly not the way you simply refused to listen to us. You did send a satisfaction survey to us but when I got to it, just a couple of weeks later, you'd expired it. No, not at all satisfied.",

On our most recent flight on 31 August 2022 from Brisbane to Singapore it was so different. The staff were surly and had a particularly poor attitude towards caucasions. They were friendly enough towards their fellow Asians.  We have never experienced this before on any airline, but found this particularly surprising in an airline like SIA.  We did a further flight in early September in Premium Economy from Singapore to London - see separate review. Lift your game SIA. We won't be back. We did not feel welcome.",
                    "One positive was the flat bed seat.  Apart from that the service was very average, the  food maybe the equivalent of premium economy at best and the drink (bloody mary) the worst I've had on any airline in any class, including economy.  The host even joked that they had to make it from scratch as they did not have any of the pre-made mixer.  The only reason I created this profile was to comment on the airline.

                    "Cabin crew were not only charming and immaculate, but also very kind and helpful. I flew on the 15:00 p.m Sydney to Singapore on the 5th April and boy were the ladies in the cabin crew out to impress? Fair to say I flew on few airlines but this was the best out of all of them! \nSingapore made a very good investment in the human element and the cabin crew will charm the socks out of you! Would I fly with SQ again? You bet your hat I will!\n\nWell done! ✅️",
                    "Paid 3,000 for premium economy.the flight attendants look beautiful. That’s because they don’t do anything. Never again. So disappointed. No service. Don’t pick up trash. You get one bottle of water for a 17 hour flight. Food was awful. Looked like economy. Why would I pay for upgrade??? Dirty. No tooth brush. You might find one in the economy bathroom when flight first starts otherwise forget it. Seats are uncomfortable. You ask a question, they don’t have an answer. Fly another airline. Heard so much about this airline. So disappointed! ",
                    "Singapore Airlines (SIA) is terrible\nOutbound\nI fly with a piece of medical equipment called a portable Oxygen Concentrator (POC). During long-hall flights, I always request the seat with a 10A outlet socket that can be used for medical equipment Every long-hall aircraft has these. Normal outlets for laptops etc. are 5A, so will trip out. Contacted SIA on many occasions to ensure the appropriate seat was reserved. Silence from SIA until a few days before departure so there was doubt about my departing Australia up until the morning of my departure on 10/8.22. My travel agent’s last words to me were “good luck”… Luckily, I plugged in and the flight to Singapore was uneventful.\nChangi Airport: Taken off 2 flights in Singapore as the seat with the medical equipment (10A) socket was taken. Medical equipment sockets (10A) are always bulkhead window seats. Staff had no idea about these power-points and insisted that I was using the wrong adaptors. On the second disembarkation, I was shouted at and abused by 5 members of the public on the plane, who demanded that I was removed from the plane as they had connecting flights and I was delaying departure. I remonstrated, advising that it wasn’t my fault and was told by SIA staff to “calm down”.\nMy luggage was unloaded, taken to some holding area and I was advised that as it was now past midnight, I was to be put up in an internal hotel in the airport, so my luggage had to be retrieved and taken to my room. Settled by 2am. 20+ hours at the airport.\nAdvised that I was to be flown to Manchester rather than LHR. No options given.\nPurchased duty free booze that was put in my luggage. Escorted to the 3rd flight with my luggage just fitting through the hand luggage x-ray machine (why?).\nManaged to book 2 nights at Manchester at my cost, to put me back on schedule for my trip to Oxford. My meetings at West Wales were cancelled.\nArrived Manchester, one day late, where I didn’t want to be and found the duty free had smashed and killed my laptop.\n                                  -------------------------------------------------------\nNo news from SIA apart from one email advising that an investigation was underway.                                 \n\nReturn\n1/9/22: Arrived at LHR at 10am for a 10pm flight and made a beeline for the SIA office to ensure there would be no problems. Advised that all was noted and ok. A staff member (Michael) visited me at the coffee shop to discuss my flight and insisted that all was sorted. They still had no idea about a 5Amp vs 10Amp outlet socket, nor the minimum of 2 x 10 Amp medical equipment outlet sockets that are on all 777’s, 350’s and 380’s as I discovered after talking to a SIA engineer later in Singapore. \nPut on a flight 2 hours before my scheduled flight and I was suddenly upgraded to first class (I can guess that they were advised that there was a plug available in 1st class and a movable customer there, but not business class on my booked flight) and on boarding, noted that the occupant of the window, bulkhead seat had been moved to a centre seat, so that I could have the required seat. I plugged my POC in and immediately tripped the power. A 5 Amp socket. More garbage about correct plugs and adaptors offered by staff. It’s not the plugs, it’s the outlet sockets.\nThis engineer guy arrived and advised that the medical device sockets are for emergency stretcher cases and the like, but are regularly used by people with POC’s and Cpap machines.  He pointed out the socket underneath the window, slid open the cover and there was the 10 Amp outlet. Surprised staff from SIA took photographs and admitted that they didn’t even know the existence of these sockets. More garbage about correct plugs and adaptors offered by staff. It’s not the plugs, it’s the outlet sockets.\nThe final flight home on the 777 was finally sorted out and I was given a window bulkhead seat 18K. The power supply for this flight came from overhead power outlet (with a Medical Cross sticker on the small overhead locker) without problems.\nAll should be OK now if SIA realise and admit that they had no idea of what was going and train their relevant staff. Absolutely no one knew what to do as I advised over and over again, to no avail. Complete incompetence. \nWhen I book with Qantas, the note in my file immediately allocates me the window bulkhead seat that has the 10Amp socket on any long-haul flight. I have no choice. This is done at time of booking (which I normally do 3-4 months in advance) to ensure no other passengers book my required seat. Simple, isn’t it? Not for SIA and a terrible experience for me. \nI sent SIA my Qantas medical clearance form (unrequested) as they had not requested a SIA form and I was worried, from previous experience, with their silence. Finally received SIA form very late, returned asap and that’s when things went downhill. Questions about oxygen flow rates, pressures? Who is running this section of SIA?\nOne call to Qantas, once, and all is sorted. SIA need to lift its game markedly if it wants further business. A terrible; no disgusting way to treat a customer. Certainly destroyed the memories of my holiday. Extra transport and accommodation costs were incurred but SIA have never offered any recompence. Long planned meetings were cancelled due to being transported to Manchester instead of London. SIA has done nothing and has not advised if they have changed their operational procedures to ensure that this sort of stuff-up does not occur to anyone. Stoney silence from SIA confirms, in my eyes, the contempt that they hold for customers, even top dollar Business Class passengers like me.\nI would strongly urge anyone considering booking with SIA to seriously reconsider their plans, as I would not want anyone else’s holiday to be destroyed by this uncaring company. Two months after my return flight, There is still nothing from SIA. \nCaveat emptor.\n\nDavid Astin\nP.O. Box 3157\nPort Adelaide\nSouth Australia",
                    "Excellent service from start to finish - very helpful and friendly staff, we left on time (actually early on 2 flights), great transfer service. ",
                    "The customer service provided by the Singapore Arlines agents in Kochi was excellent. They were very friendly and approachable people and helped me out a lot. Special thanks to customer service agent Abins Pius who saw through all procedures till the very end. And as usual, the cabin crew in Singapore Airlines were impeccable and will continue flying with Singapore airlines whenever possible.",
                    "The stewards onboard the flight from singapore to london did not offer any water or fluids throughout the whole flight which we considered very poor service. They did offer them with the meals but not at other times.",
                    "A ground staff member was extremely rude and misbehaved with us yesterday at Changi Airport around 7:30 pm at T3 gate A19. His name was Shiva or Shivam, and he was most likely of South Asian descent. He kept making rude gestures to my parents and me, both senior citizens, and after confronting him, he said he had every right to do so. He kept on changing the queue and continuously harrased us. We were tired and exhausted after 10 hour flight from Christchurch which was delayed. As a passenger I have paid the full price of my economy class ticket. We deserve the same amount of respect and courtesy to be extended to us as given to those in first and business class passengers. This discriminatory classist and racist behaviour has left a bitter taste in my mouth. We deserve an apology. I am very upset and disappointed with the world's leading airline.",
                    "A trusted source had always raved about Singapore Airlines to me. It remains my only flight with them, a return one in 2016, but I can say the customer service is second to none, and I have Qatar Airways and Cathay Pacific top of my list. They make sure you are hydrated and well fed, constantly bringing around drinks and snacks and walking up and down the aisles to collect your rubbish. I had a special meal so I wasn't entitled to the ice-cream dessert for the standard meals, but the lovely air stewardess remembered and gave the spare one leftover to me. Not only do they have metal cutlery, but the air steward I asked many questions to answered them all. Changi Airport is familiar to me and rates highly on my list of best airports in the World and they did not disappoint. Instead of an hour until boarding for my connecting flight, I had twenty minutes due to the pilots arriving late at Heathrow: as soon as we set foot in Changi airport, there was one staff person waiting to tell us where to go and they gave me very clear instructions. I did not miss my flight.",
                    "I am writing this review because we travelled on from Singapore on an aircraft which had the older Singapore Airlines's business class seats and what a difference they are from the new ones. Wide, comfortable, plenty of places to store items, a solid table and a wide area in which the stretch legs.  The new seats are a step backwards as the seat was hard and uncomfortable, the table a folding affair, apart from a pocket near the legs which can't be accessed when the seat is in the lying position, there is nowhere to put items and the area to position legs is so narrow that it is only possible to lie on one side or on the back.  The cabin crew, as always, were the very best but why change the seat design from one which was one of the best?",
                    "This review covers four business class flights with SIA and they don't come close to either Etihad or Emirates. The lounge at Heathrow has a great view with floor to ceiling windows, or it would have if they were clean. Obviously there'd been children wiping their hands and faces all over the glass, a little off putting to put it mildly, and the lounge itself was very busy. The food was awful, I've had better breakfasts at Wetherspoons!\nThe flight to Singapore was ok apart from the seat configuration meaning that if the seat was in lie flat mode you had to lie at an angle with only a small recess to put your feet. The inflight entertainment offered a very poor selection right across the board, very little on there to interest me which is something I've not encountered on any other airline.\nThe positives were the food and the crew, both very good.\nFlying from Changi on different flight, the lounge was packed and had hardly any western food, not great when my only real choice was crisps. The flight to Adelaide was ok but, given that it was a night flight, it was obvious that the crew just wanted to get us fed and turn the lights down as quickly as possible, a real dip in service there.\nOur flight from Cairns to Singapore was a beauty, upon check in we were told there was no Business Class lounge and we were given a voucher each for twenty Australian dollars as compensation. Some compensation this was as it wasn't even enough to cover a drink and a sandwich but surely it would get better on the flight? No, the starter advertised as smoked duck somehow morphed into smoked salmon, ah well, they both live in water so I suppose that was near enough. My wife asked for a glass of Shiraz as advertised in the in flight menu, none available so she settles for the Chianti. Upon asking for a refill we were told they'd run out so it was on to whatever they could find! The choice of five deserts shrank to just ice cream or cheese and biscuits but by this stage we were no longer surprised although when they told us that they didn't have any brandy we were really taken aback. It should be noted that there was only ten business class seats on this flight and they couldn't even service that small number efficiently, not a criticism on the crew, just shocking planning.\nOur flight back to Heathrow was again marred by the seat configuration, when you've paid such a premium for business class only to find that you can't get comfortable on a fourteen hour flight is simply not acceptable.\nIn my opinion, SIA are now a long way behind their competitors and, reading other reviews, it seems they don't care. I have communicated my thoughts to their customer service but I'm not holding my breath waiting for any response or resolution. There are alternatives to this airline and I would suggest that people should explore them",
                    "Received a bottle of water at the start of the 16hr flight, and finally had to walk to the back of the plane to ask for another bottle of water, this after about 7 hrs. Food? One meal at the start of the flight, and as i sit here writing this 11 hrs into the flight, no more food, i.e. meals or snacks. Oh, no stewardesses either. I get better service on a 1 hr flight on southwest!",
                    "The flight attendant on SQ222 20th september 3pm flight. Mr. Koh provided us with elexelent service! We were seated near their service stations and observed that Mr. Koh inarticulate was very quick in doing his task and was very attentive to passengers. He quickly noticed that my mother (Nurfaezah) was in need so assistance due to her old age and took very good care of her during the long flight. She was very happy.  \n\nWe usually fly using Singapore Airlines so we are used to the services usually provided to us and it is our preferred mode of travel. However, Mr. Koh made our trip especially memorable. We would like to thank him for his outstanding service and hopes he progresses his career further! Wishing him all the best!  \n\nThank you for the great service!",
                    "I flew Singapore Airlines for several flights in December. Most of the time, the service was good, but on my flight from SIN to SFO, the flight attendants’ service went down over the course of the flight. I’m averse to seafood so I did not eat the smoked salmon or shrimp salad appetizers. The flight attendant serving me starting acting more judgy after that, saying, “I guess you’re not gonna eat this” while taking away the appetizer and giving me the main dish. Also, for the shrimp salad appetizer I was never given the bread supposed to come with it. After the main meal I wasn’t given the snack (grapes and cheese) or the dessert, until I asked for the dessert. My dishes also weren’t taken away within an hour unless I pressed the person button thing. That bothered me because I wanted to rest and I couldn’t clear my table and put the tray away unless I asked. The flight attendants on that trip, two of them didn’t provide the best service and did the bare minimum so that they could go back to talking with the other flight attendants. I’m sure other passengers needed service too, but instead of working, the flight attendants talked during most of the flight for an hour or more to each other. However, other cabin crews in my experience on Singapore Airlines were better and less gossipy and chit chatty during the flight.",
                    "Business Class\n\nThe lounge in Charles De Gaulle - Horrible,  cheap wine and food that even the servers didn't want to eat.  I complained about the food and was told \"the boss makes the food decisions and I bring my own in\"\n\nThe flight:-\n\nMy wife filled in our food choices before we left home,  the attendants didn't have ours requests\nThe food we did get was served after the people who had pre-booked the choices\nMy wife sat next to me and got her food 15 minutes after me and 40 minutes after the passengers who hadn't had the pre-orders lost\nThe food was BLAND\nI got my cutlery after my first dish was served and taken away\nWe had a passenger with a terribly loud cough,  he coughed for the duration of the flight - horrible, impossible to sleep\n\nThe return flight they forgot to take all the packaging off my burger,  I ate half a piece of paper,  is this really good service?",
                    "On the flight from Singapore to Johannesburg we had very good service from the flight attendants.  However on the last leg from Jnb to Cape Town both the male and female flight attendants were very abrupt and even rude especially to my wife sitting at seat 16F, not caring like during the main flight. We do not expect this type of treatment in business class. Singapore airlines need to investigate who those flight attendants were and do something about it.",
                    "Having traveled in February 2020 we were very excited to fly them again. Sadly- many things have changed and not for the better. \n\nNo drink service before meal, only offered drink with meal service and we had to walk to  back of plane to find crew for another glass of wine. \n\nThe food was poor, and after trying to call, no emails ever answered within 2 weeks, I used last resort of Twitter. I was assured thru Twitter I could get a vegetarian meal ( online system did not offer any way to pick meals for 15 hour flight😭). Since my meal never was arranged the crew found a vegan meal for me which was nice of them but it had no flavors. Rice dry and barely edible.  The second meal was more of the same with dry rice, overcooked shrimp and so many hot green chilies we could barely eat it.  Thinking we could get snacks- we were sad to see all junk food. Chips. Chocolate bar. Packaged sweet bread. Raisins. \n\nThe A350 was ok- cracks in bathroom cabinet, tray tables slanted in bulkhead row, less movies on demand. We sat in premium economy which was nice with good seats and recline. \n\nThe crew was ok- not the usual amazing staff you expect. They did meal service and vanished. \n\nWe paid for premium economy for the seats and space- not sure it’s worth it. Had better service and food on United airlines which shows how far things have changed at SQ air.",
                    "My family of four travelled to LA on Singapore Airlines form Bangkok. In Bangkok, the  airport lounge conveniently located at the D Gates in Bangkok and the first flight was excellent with reclining seats and attentive staff. \nWe had a two hour turnaround in Bangkok and we were all able to shower and freshen up in the Singapore lounge before setting off again. The lounge in Singapore was busy, but had ample seats for us. \nThe second flight to LA was on time and featured the wider seats. My children loved them and were able to sleep very comfortably. I ( just under 6 ft) had to use the small leg space and sleep at a slight angle which worried me. However, it worked fine and I managed a good 6 hours. \nDespite this being a flight, the food was a the star of the show with an excellent fish dish and a quality steak. You can preselect all your dishes beforehand. The staff were very accommodating at delaying the meal service for children. \nThe film selection was good, and we all found the 15 hours passed very quickly. \nThe staff were excellent and this made the flight the start of the holiday.",
                    "It was wonderful. I mean, they had good food and entertainment for the people. They even provided pillows and eye masks and headphones, and I slept nicely.",
                    "Not happy at all with the service provided on Singapore Airlines Premium Economy on the A380. I flew on the Boeing 777 from Sydney to Singapore, and then the A380 from Singapore to London. The 13 hour journey was quite a struggle despite spending a significant amount of money on premium economy seats it did not live up to expectation at all!\n Felt like we were treated like economy class despite paying a huge amount more. Firstly there was no hot towel or drink before takeoff which was disappointing and would have helped feel relaxed and refreshed before takeoff. \nIn terms of the seats the leg room was decent, plenty of room to fully extend your legs but the seats were not that comfortable. \nIn terms of entertainment, it was good had a solid range of movies and shows to watch on board, would recommend to put more than 1 season of tv shows, as people want to binge watch seasons on a long flight. However, really disappointed there was no live sport, I was keen to watch the Premier League whilst in the air but it wasn't available on the A380 which was quite annoying and I was not happy with that. The WIFI was also terrible, it was only available for about 30 minutes of the trip, again disappointing. \nIn terms of food I was very disappointed, the book the cook is a great initiative with some great options. The food was okay, not the best quality but it was sufficient. However, this is my biggest problem! There was only 2 meals provided on a 13 hour trip. Within a day I would usually eat 3 main meals Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner over the course of 12 hours that I am awake. On this flight you were served breakfast 1 hour after takeoff and then lunch 4/5 hours later. Meaning for the next 6 hours there was no food to eat. I had to ask the flight attendent for a snack, also ate some of the snacks provided but was still starving. There needs to be another substanstial meal before a few hours before landing. \nIn terms of service from flight attendents it was okay, they came through regularly with drinks which was good, however in terms of amentity kits you have to ask for them, and they were so bad with barely anything in them. It was disappointing. In terms of treatment from flight attendents I didn't feel like I was looked after for the amount of money I paid. If this was economy, I would be pleased, however I paid a significantly large amount of money for the premium economy experience and I wasn't impressed at all. \nIn terms of toilets we also had to share with economy, despite it being promoted as having our own toilets \nOverall it was a very average experience, and needs to be better. I am very disappointed as I had high expectations of singapore airlines and wouldnt recommend it to friends or family unless something changes. ",
                    "We flew on Singapore Airlines B787-10 for this flight. The Economy Class cabin is further segregated into two sections, with 150 seats in the forward cabin and 151 in the aft cabin. Singapore Airlines uses three colours: brown, grey, and turquoise, for its Economy Class seats. In addition, the use of mood lighting for different moments of the flight, such as white lighting during boarding and disembarking and purple/orange lighting during the morning flight time, allows passengers to relax during the flight.\n\nThere are several lavatories dotted across the two sections of the Economy Class. The lavatory onboard is not exactly the largest, but it is very functional. The mirrors in the lavatory make the space appears larger than it is. The hardworking cabin crews on Singapore Airlines constantly kept the lavatory very clean for the duration of the fight. I like the touch-free features, such as the sensor-activated tap and the toilet flush to the step-activated trash bin cover, which provided convenience to passengers and were extremely important in this endemic period. Singapore Airlines is one of the few airlines worldwide that still provides toothbrushes in their lavatories other than the standard hand soap.\n\nEconomy Class seats on Singapore Airlines B787-10 are arranged in a 3-3-3 configuration. Each seat has a 32″ seat pitch and measures 17″ wide with a 5″ recline. Despite the very thin-looking Economy Class seats on Singapore Airlines, which do not seem to provide much cushioning, these seats are very comfortable for the short two-hour flight. In addition, the four-way adjustable headrest contributes to the comfort afforded by these Economy Class seats. The controls for reading light control and call attendant buttons are found under the IFE screen. There is also a sizable tray table on every seat. A standalone cup holder is fitted under the IFE screen, allowing passengers to stow their cups of drinks without needing to deploy the tray table. The seat pockets on Singapore Airlines are designed to allow passengers to maximise the usage of these pockets and also make it easier for passengers to locate the items they placed inside the pockets. \n\nAn 11.1″ touchscreen TV is fitted in every Economy Class seat. There are many entertainment options on Singapore Airlines’ KrisWorld, ranging from the latest Hollywood blockbusters to TV shows. The intuitive menu options on KrisWorld are very well organised, making scrolling through them a breeze. Singapore Airlines provides earplugs for every passenger, though some might not find stuffing things in their ears comfortable. Singapore Airlines also provides complementary wifi for its KrisFlyer members (regardless of status) and passengers flying in Business Class or higher cabins. The wifi onboard is very stable but can only handle chats, email browsing and uploading to social media.\n\nWe were given two options for breakfast today – Singapore Fried Carrot Cake with Prawns and Scrambled Eggs with Chicken Sausage. I chose the Fried Carrot Cake for breakfast. I am not a fan of the take-out box design used in regional Economy Class, as it made the portion feel small and was challenging to eat from. Singapore Airlines only served its Economy Class passengers a yoghurt. The meal was delicious and full of flavours. My friend opted for the Scrambled Eggs and found the eggs to be a tad dry and the sausage bland.\n\nService onboard Singapore Airlines was impeccable, as always. We were greeted by the warm and friendly cabin crews. The cabin crew worked tirelessly to serve all the passengers and attended to their requests despite being a full flight. Despite the clear delineation of the duties of each flight attendant, cabin crews were ready to step in to help their colleagues should one be away from their station (during meal service) to top up food or handle other passenger requests not available on the food cart. The flight attendants’ felt happy in their job, which also translates to caring for their passengers.",

There was no menu for choices just was given a Tray. Never saw the attendant after that. I was woken up about 8 hours into  a 18 hour flight to ask if I needed lunch. After that never saw an attendant  . The bed space was small. Never given any toiletries which most Airlines offer \nAll in all Singapore Airline was a disappointment to me. Will never fly it again",

                    "Well I have flown to Australia quite a few times with other airlines. Also flown many counties around the world. But I have a fear of heights and flying. I just try and keep my mind off that I'm in the air. Most flight will get a bit of turbulence now and then. It can't be helped, but both the 13hr flight from Heathrow to Singapore. Then the connecting flight from Singapore to Sidney had severe turbulence for 90% of each flight. It was literally like travelling down a bumpy road for the whole journey on both flights with the patches of extra bad turbulence. I spent the whole 2 flights terrified and shaking. Not what you want when flying for 20hrs with a fear of flying. I mean I know turbulence can't be helped, but how could I possible have consistent permanent turbulence for basically the entirety of 2 flight from one side of the world to the other. I don't know if you teach your pilots to fly a certain way, or maybe take short cuts somehow. But it was one of the most terrifying couple of days in my life. And the worst thing about it is I have to fly back with them in 2 weeks",

                    "Singapore airlines have wonderful attentive staff who look after everyone, even in economy. The food is good and the inflight entertainment was great. If only they would advertise baby free flights as we had about a dozen on our overnight return flight!",
                    "My husband were told we needed to purchase premium economy tickets in order to get the upgrade to business class.  We did this to our deepest regret.  Firstly, Singapore Airlines refused our upgrade, in the hopes of selling tickets at normal prices.\nUnder normal times I can understand this reasoning, and with every other airline in the Star alliance groip we have always been able to get the upgrade at the latest at the airport.\nFirstly, the premium economy is not worth paying double the price for.  The seats are uncomfortable, and the service isnt great.\nThen, it is really disappointing ehen there is NO-ONE in business class, and they still wont grant an upgrade.\nI am truly disappointed in Singapore Airlines policies regarding the upgrade.  If they dont want to accept the Star Alliance miles, they should get out of the ptogram\nExtremely disappointed, and out of principal, will never fly with them again.",
                    "Flew with Singapore Airlines with my fmaily members of total 2 adults and 2 kids and this time sitting at Economy Class.\n\nI am expecting the usual great service, smile and courtesy with reasonable food but I am rather disappointed as compare to those reviews that I read. The male steward, I guess the supervisor (as seems older than everyone), just like a robot and does not have expression on his face when offering service to the passenger. In fact it is close to \"does not care\" kind of attitude.\n\nFood, just so so\n\nEntertainment is the only thing good about this flight.",
                    "This flight was really good as I always choose Singapore airlines, because of their classic but sophisticated meals, seats and crew. I always love flying with SIA on business, no pygamas for long haul flights though... Overall the best airline for me. Tickets are insane now though..",
                    "We travelled on Suite class on SQ A380 both ways to & fro Sin Ldn about 2 weeks ago. \n\nWe have also done First Class from Singapore and returned from London in 777 suite pre-COVID before.\n\nThis review is a comparison for these 2 trips both Sin-Ldn and back.\n\nCons:  \n\n1)   Pre-Covid FOOD served on Board --- We were extremely impressed with our first class trip from Sin - Ldn.  I am a foodie.  The food served on this leg was very memorable.  We always order the lobster from book the cook because my partner loves to eat seafood and for me I was never once impressed with their lobtser served on their business class normaly. \n\nThis pre-COVID first class trip meal was the best I ever had on SQ. The lobster was done very well and prepared more extravagantly than what we were normally offered on normal business class. U could tell it's first class with a big difference.  Pre-COVID, SQ also offer delicious Japanese Kaiseki Meal on First class which we paired with sake.  Really felt like having a Michelin star meal. \n\n- Recent trip on A380 suite from Sin to Ldn. Food in the Private Room was good. We had lobster in laksa gravy. The lobster was fresh and laksa gravy was good.  We did not eat much because we have ordered our meal on board from book the cook.\nIt was a mistake; we should have had our full meal in the private room before boarding the plane because after that all the main courses quality went downhill.  \n\nWe ordered the lobster and beef from Book the Cook.  There is no difference in terms of taste, quality or presentation from the Business Class we flew to France 2 months prior.  Very ordinary and was not tasty at all.  The beef was overly salted. In fact I prefered the beef cheek I have ordered for our business class to France. Didn't expect the Food on Suite can be so disappointing. Total letdown. \n\nThe only saving grace was a delicious chinese clear soup served from Sin to Ldn.  The same  soup was served on our returned flight and was not tasty at all.  \n\nFood on both return flights from London to Sin was not palatable.  The mains were bad and the dessert was even worse.  i even commented to a flight stewardess that some economy class box meals on regional flights tasted much better.  \n\n2)  In my opinion the seat for Suite class is not as comfortable as the business or first class seat.  The only plus point is you get an extra double bed if you travel with a partner. To be honest I much prefer a business / First Class seat.\n\n3) Business class 2 months ago-  Passenger will not be provided with amenity kit if one does not request.  Unlike in the past the stewardess will ask if you would like to have one.\n\n4) Suite class Feb 2023 - There is no lip gross in the amenity bag.  Luckily I brought one along myself.  SQ used to include little crystal fishes' ornament in the past for your collection but now not anymore. There are not many items provided.  So please bring your own.\n\nPro:\n\n1) It's spacious.  You will have the feeling that you're staying in a small hotel room rather than on an airplane.\n\n2) Service. \n    i)  Pre-Covid service on First Sin- London was excellent + excellent\n        returned trip on SQ 777 suite was forgettable\n\n   ii)  Recent trip to & fro Sin - London on A380 suite, all the crews were very attentive and prefessional.  \n\nI flew with my partner.  SQ has sent an email to my partner requesting for a review but I didn't received one.   Hence this review.",
                    "It is really upsetting that they don’t allow for advanced online seat selection. Thus I have to reach airport 3 hours before the flight just to secure a seat which I prefer. Sigh. And their leg room is smaller than other flights like Emirates which is a bit uncomfortable for long haul fight.",
                    "Wow. First flight with Singapore Airlines post pandemic and its nearly unrecognisable.\n\n- new aircraft have much more cramped seating\n- food is nearly inedible\n- inflight entertainment system not working\n\nThe crew remain very attentive and tried their best to resolve the entertainment issues. But given such a poor product to begin with there efforts were redundant.\n\nVery poor value airline. Why pay top price for a extremely bad experience?\n\nFly anything but Singapore Airlines.",
                    "No pepper and salt for meals which is quite tastless !!  service has change to simplify e.g. Steward dont offer for more drink as before, no toy for kid.",
                    "Good day,\n                    No Improvement.\n                   The food was worst than ever.\n                   Dosed up on many pain killers, as seats are at a discomfort. My Back has not recovered, never ever again on the worst airline. I have tried emailing but to no avail. They are hiding from criticism. May I suggest fly with their opposition.\n                   Norman Russell",
                    "We normally fly with an other airline to Singapore and might have had a different expectation. Admit, everything for a standard business class is available. Huge seats with all comfort and options. We had to fly with SIA due to the VTL rule when we booked the trip. Anyhow, we had a pleasant flight with (basic?) business class service. The service during the \"dark\" hours were non limited. No staff offering water or other drinks, no ice cream or other refreshments. A steward offered sweets shortly before breakfast. Else, you had to get it yourself in the pantry. Despite the connotation, we had a pleasant flight but missed the panache we had expected from the reputation of SIA. Maybe the expectation was exaggerated. \n\nA suggestion: if you serve the satay, please offer a cloth napkin so you can fix it to a button. The sauce tend to drip and drop off the skewers and ruin your clothes. The extra laundry tab for the napkins won't make the difference.",
                    "I have flown many times on Singapore Airlines over the past 15 years except during Covid 2020-2021.\nI was looking forward to my flights booking again, but how the level of service has changed for the worst.\nCebu - Singapore was on budget airline Scoot, the low-cost carrier of the Singapore Airlines Group.\nNice meal served chicken and vegetables - up to standard for a budget airline. I paid $4 for a cup of tea. I was ready for the usual very good meal on the 2nd leg Singapore to Sydney. It used to be entre fruits with beautiful main meal, This time is was one meal - 6 chunks of chicken on a huge bed of noodles. And that's it. No veges - very plain cheap meal. I had a cup of tea and later an ice cream. Guess what - the meal on the Scoot the budget airline was far better than what was served on the main Singapore Airlines flight. No chance of a second cup of tea - the crew zoomed down the aisles with trolleys so fast, call out and they don.t stop. No drinks later in the flight except just before landing and water only. used to be regular service of juices AND a snack meal 60-90 minutes before landing in Sydney.\nIt appears this airline is making up for lost income during covid by giving less food and beverages during flights. Well on a nearly 8 hour flight on a top reputation international airline you do expect a meal of reasonable quality not at a standard below budget airlines. \nBest they jack up the price by say $25 and give passengers the food and beverage service they are used to. I also might add I greatly miss the Chess game that was always in the Games in In-flight Entertainment. Chess should be a standard inclusion but they have taken it out. A budget decision?",
                    "I am a regular flyer of SIA on this route.\nIn the recent travel, I found the SIA management has decided to continue degraded service in this route (and in other routes).\n\nI am not sure why it is Skytrax's number-one airline.\n\nThe service level is still a degraded version relative to pre-COVID in this route. \n--there is no snack packet/fruit juice before meal service\n-- Toys to kids are of very cheap/degraded quality relative to pre-covid and other top-level airlines such as Emirates, Qatar\n-- Food quantity remains reduced amount and in smaller boxes (relative to pre-covid)\n-- Delay in departure continues \n-- In-flight entertainment options are much less than other top-level airlines",
                    "I had some issues getting checked in for my flight and could not be happier with the service I received at ticketing.\nBetsy, Deborah, and especially Marybelle were all so patient and helped me get everything sorted out.  They were professional and friendly while I waited to find out if I could board the flight first to Singapore, then to Bali.\nI wish all airlines had employees like these ladies - I will only chose Singapore Airlines any time it is an option in the future.\n\nThe aircraft was very nice, and the flight attendants were all amazing.   Even though I was in economy, I was able to rest comfortably, and the food was good.  Great choices of in-flight entertainment as well.",
                    "We we moved from emergency exit seat because one of us is too big to be fit for that seat when we paid more for that seat which wasn’t refunded, the flight manager was horrible, no manners. Then we waited extra 1/2 hr than everyone for our meals and then the connecting flight was boarded then Un boarded again and delayed us for 1.5 hours",
                    "Singapore Airlines used to be great, but their standards have slipped.  The economy seats are so uncomfortable.  Their budget airline Scoot is far superior in this respect.\nFlights are often late and no one seems to care any more.  The prices are absurd now.\nThe planes are also rather old and tired.  They need to get newer planes and make the seats suitable for long flights.",
                    "Terrible service \nMy mom who has a disability did not receive wheelchair. \nFood was terrible and they didn’t give her extra biscuits. She couldn’t eat any food… it was that bad. When she called for help they never showed up. Terrible that Singapore airlines is having a nose dive. \nVery upset and unbelievably bad service. ",
                    "my first flight was from brisbane to singapore. the second was from  singapore to zurich, but it was late and missed the connection to birmigham. l was re-directed through Munich and after waiting in both airports subsequently arrived in Birmingam courtesy of air dolomit @ 1700 on 14.6.22 (instead of 0800 as planned.) l was not offered a meal or even drinks  and l would like to know if this is typical of the service l can expect when l book future trips to brisbane because if so, l will use other airlines",
                    "SQ meet & assist is a joke. I called multiple times to confirm if they can help an elderly to check in at the hotel in Jewel Changi upon arrival to Singapore and they confirmed multiple times over the phone that that's something they always do. Guess what, on the day of, they refuse to send a non-English speaking elderly to the hotel and conveniently blamed it on the associates that told me in the first place. They recommend my elderly to sleep on the lobby in the terminal instead. What a service! Truly disappointed how this went down and they don't seem to care to accommodate anything. I would not recommend any minors, kids or elderly under SQ care because they are unprofessional, unreliable and has no empathy.",
                    "I flew from SYD to IND in March this year (2023), I was so lucky that I chose SIA as the airline for both two ways, I was on Economy class. Usually the problem with most airlines is the amount of legroom available in Economy, but with Singapore Airlines super kind and friendly staff, the legroom was not a problem, the airline arrived at time and actually landed quite early than expect (40 minutes before) which was amazing. The food was also very great,  most of the time airline food is horrible but Singapore Airlines food was one of the best ones in an aircraft. Overall, because of the friendliness of the staff, I would highly recommend anyone this airline.",
                    "After reading some negative reviews I was concerned about flying but I certainly should NOT have been. The service was second to none. The staff were very professional  but o friendly and nothing was too much trouble. ?the beds were comfy, there was plenty of room and the entertainment choice was wide and varied with recently released films for February 2023 available.\nWould highly recommend this company",
                    "I know this may sound like a first world problem but the new seats in biz class in SQ are badly designed. I’m usually tolerant of airline seats but this new seats were causing a lot of problems for me. Specifically:\n\nleg room - encased in a structure whereby one has to slide up from the seat to fold one’s legs. I’m 187 cm (6’1”), so this may not be a problem for those shorter but the leg room (width and height) severely restricts rotation-ability when lying down as well as trying to get up from the seat. Sleeping was torture as one couldn’t turn or fold their legs. \n\nI urge SQ to take a look at Etihad or Qatar for some inspiration!",
                    "My partner and i decided to travel to Australia on Singapore airlines,the checking in at London Heathrow was very easy,the plane was quite comfortable considering a 22 hour trip,the cabin crew were very friendly and acomadating,drinks when you wanted it and two meals to Singapore and plenty of films,tv programmes and music on our individual screens, we had a night in a Singapore airport before continuing our journey to Sydney ,our return journey eighteen days later was good but with only two hours stop in Singapore airport before returning to London ,with the same quality service from Singapore airlines",
                    "I have flown with Singapore Airlines for over twenty years with every flight being great. But my how things have changed. Had flights to London in June and back from Amsterdam in October and both where very poor. We all understand the situation after Covid, but there was a definite lack of care on our flights. The stewards were O.K. but they have all forgotten how to smile, and a couple where actually quite rude. The service was a disgrace. A meal was served not long after leaving Amsterdam, and then we waited nine and a half hours before a second meal was supplied. Beer and wine aren't offered, you have to ask. Beer is beer, but my wife had one selection of wine and she said it was awful. Before I fly again, I will definitely check reviews before I make a booking, and I seriously doubt it will be with Singapore Airlines.",
                    "SA is famous of its service and safety, but, what happens to the food they served?  \nTook a round trip premium Economy LAX NRT, speaking of bad menu.  For two meals they served the same Bread, salad, and condiments.  The main course was the worst I’ve ever had.  \n\nOn the flight back from Tokyo, chicken or hamburger were the options.  The sauce on the rice came with the hamburger was really bad.  \n\nEither way i l consumed only 1/3 of the main course.  Personally, I usually finish everything even it was considered bad airline food, but this trip, I couldn’t even finish every single meal.  \n\nSA needs to have some real chef to look into their current menu.",
                    "What was so hard was change in flights times at airport where the change was so close to next flight, most of passengers on our previous flight from Copenhagen to Singapore were like us, had to run to get to the gate, go through customs and the lines were so long, all passengers called during the line up. Because of the big rush belongings were left behind my husbands good hat, people had moved it and we missed it (we wrote to Singapore Airlines about this) the worst thing was our Grandson's Epi Pen for his peanut allergy was left on the plane. My daughter had to again run back to the plane to get the epi-pen.  On the flight there was no record of our grandson's peanut allergy, we had requested no peanuts in the food, no one knew of this, the travel agent was given the information and gave it to Singapore Airlines. Our daughter had a seat on a long flight which would not recline on way Singapore to Copenhagen staff tried to pull it apart,  no luck, this is not so good in economy class. We did try to upgrade with our travel agent, for on way home only the cost of the seats escalated to 5 times more than what it was at Sydney airport and there were only 2 seats left. We were disillusioned. When we arrived in Sydney airport our luggage did not, due to the close times we had to get onto the plane nobody believed the luggage would make it, this was to be true. This is not to complain about Singapore Airlines but to please improve these things. It was quite stressful for all of the passengers to have such short periods with the flight changes to get on next plane. Of course the plane waited as there were so many passengers who had to get on the planes....but it was just too much to deal with.  Prior to this we had travelled with Singapore Airlines with no problem, what has happened.?",
                    "Well where to start. My wife and I were travelling with our 2 children 1 and 7yrs old from Per to Lax return, mid Feb....yes I know, we took our little ones on business but for the most part they were good kids. Notably the 1 year old is slugged almost $1000 to be in business class, nothing more, and the 7 year old is slugged full fare ~7k. (Not whinging about that, just adding the details for those who may be curious.)\nSo ill shave alot of the issues out and just provide the good stuff. \nFrom the moment you arrive at the Perth broom closet also known as the Singapore airlines lounge, you find yourself thinking hmmm ok, maybe emerates would have been worth the extra 10k. The Perth lounge for Singapore is or at least should be embarrassing for the company.  It's more dr waiting room, where everyone starres at each other and of course there is zero ambience. No music No nothing, just the sounds of people going to the toilet in the background....after they have cued for the only single toilets available of course. \nOnce settled .....Into standing around, because there are no seats, you find yourself wanting a 5am coffee, however of course there is only 1 lady working on what can only be described accurately as a coffee cart, by herself....as Friendly she is though,.there is one cart surrounded by over 150 people...you couldn't dream up a funny script like this if you tried and of course, this is real. Don't worry it gets sooooo much better.\n\nWe decide to leave the broom cupboard and wait amugst the masses for a cuppa (not bad for a 30k investment), and of course we had more luck seeing jesus walk on water before we got anywhere near the front of the coffee line....so no coffee. By now though, we have the most amazing backing tracks to compliment the seamless singapore airlines experience....yep.\nyou guessed right, the 1yr old was now performing some fine out of key opera, and to be honest, pre coffee in a 30k hole, I couldn't care less...sing my son, \nLet the airline hear your talent.....\n\nAs we step onto the plane, which did depart on time, we are quick to learn that the seats don't operate correctly.......ohhhhh goodness....this was meant to be a 20year anniversary gift to my wife.....really it's just a kick to her shins as this is off to a fine start......\n\nSo I hail the cabin manager who offers to tape the seat with....GAFFA TAPE. No joke, gaffa tape......We took photos because it was quite romantic and no one would believe us if we told them, loo so photos were a must. \n\nSet off in flight and safe to say, im hungry and looking forward to the 'book the cook'meals I pre ordered and recieved confirmation for....I mean seriously, what could go wrong considering, I pre planned so far in advance with so much excitement.....hmmmm, complete failure' I actually never recieved a meal. Once everyone was finished, I though, struth, I better ask these clowns where my meal is....I was told I never ordered anything, even though I showed them my book the cook confirmation receipt from the Singapore airlines app. \nThat's OK though, I'll settle for a coffee. It's not like a paid for a premium service or anything, so I quickly readjusted my expectations 😮‍💨...\n\nYou know, I could continue on with this review but im certain it will either be ignored or fall on def ears, so I wont bore you all with the many further issues on each leg of thr trip, however I can assure you the rest of this trip was terribly remarkable in a horrible sence, with problem after problem, coupled with arrogant, horroble cabin crew service for the.most part. There was a real sense that the crew thought they were the the best out there and our concerns were insignificant.....as I point to the gaffa tape lol for example.\n\nSo an update post flight, I write this review early July where I've just called the company to simply ask they provide me and my family our business reward points we were entitled to having paid a small fortune....... BUT of course I've been given the run around and told that my account is dormant and therefore the points won't be allocated unless I make a new account. \nThat would be fine if it was an old account, but I created the account beginning this year, pre flight.....the company truly is shonky.\n\nSummary: look as you can probably see reading this review, there are a few take away points, amongst many. For me most notably, is whilst Singapore's prices appear on the face of it to be better priced, there is clearly a reason for it. \n\nI don't dispute anyone who states they had a good experience with the airline and that I'm full of it....thats fine, but those people saying thst may not be payong in excess of 30k for their fligyts either.....however what I would caution is that this story of horror is actually true. It's not embellished or a joke, it's sadly true. This story sits In isolation of course but none the less it's a true story so it should make.someone second guess any thought of paying big money with this mob, considering at no point can you drop.in and sepwk to someone and get thr issues fixed and reviewed. All you can do is call the call centre as I have, and discuss the issues on all 4 flight legs with Singapore that were just terrible. \n\nNow if you snag a great economy fare and it's just you and a partner then fine, you roll with the punches, BUT if you are looking to pay in excess of 30k in flights for something special, it may be better to go with an airline that will deliver. An airline that cares about their reprutation and the implications of their poor sevice and how it impacts others. \n\nIt was our choice to spend this much I know, but the cautionary tale is still there for Any prospective people wanting to treat themselves moving fwd....id say avoid singaapore airlines for special occasions/business. \nI'd be happy to answer any questions from any one considering the same venture, as i wouldn't wish our horrible experience with sinagapore airlines, upon anyone. \n\nThey ruined our special anniversary and STILL can't be of any help to us, simply fixing our missing points. Very dissapointing, never again. \n\n",
                    "This was my first time on Singapore airlines. This is a business class seat I paid for.

                    "This was a real reduction in class from our earlier flight on SQ216; an aged Boeing 737 with drop down TV screens. Annoyed to discover that we had been allocated seats 53C & 53J, not adjacent as expected. So sorry, computer selection. Sorry didn't cut it with us as it was the 5th occasion that the computer had failed to allocate adjacent seating on Singapore/Phuket/Singapore legs of flights with SIA, this was the 7th occasion that we had flown either leg.  Luckily for us an obliging passenger switched seats. Cabin crew were friendly but disorganised when distributing the meals. Shame that the same high standards are not maintained across all routes.",
                    "I flew SQ after almost 4 years, i was very excited. All thins were good i was very happy to see the new refurbished A380.\n\nI found the seating on upper deck was very uncomfortable as the leg rest on your side and not in natural line of your body. This makes it very uncomfortable to sit and enjoy a meal / watch a movie. For sleeping it is fine, but not for sitting with legs extended.\n\nFood / Service / Crew/ Punctuality all other aspects 5/5",
                    "On 16/8 I flew from Paris to Singapore.  Throughout the flight I was served by Selina and I have to say, she worked so hard but provided service which was out of the skies!  A very smart, well spoken and customer friendly individual!  A real credit to the brand.  You ask for a drink and she will automatically come to check if you need a top up and bring snacks too, effortless, all done for you by a professional!",
                    "Seat 32A could not be reclined so it defeated the purpose of paying extra for premium economy for a comfortable seat.\n\nSeat 32C took so much effort to force it to recline. The buttons did not seem to do anything. I had to push to force it to recline.\n\nMy Singapore Sling was overly sweet and it felt it was made deliberately to avoid asking for a second one. No warm towels and a small packet of nuts given quite a while after the drinks service was completed.\n\nThere was a great movies/tv selection. The noise cancelling headphones were the large ear encompassing ones.\n\nTwo small bottles of water were sitting in between the seats.\n\nWhen we boarded at the appropriate announcement time based on sections, the cabin was full so most people had boarded earlier.\n\nThe economy class cabin had many empty seats. On reflection, had I had knowledge of seat bookings, I would have opted for economy. Premium class was not delivered.\n\nI asked for an amenity bag and the flight attendant looked and answered me with such puzzled looks, as though one such a thing did not exist. Reluctantly an economy class bag with socks and toothbrush was procured, nothing else.\n\nFood was same as economy although I pre-ordered mine. No dessert on the tray but a small tub of Hagen Daez ice cream was almost thrown at us. It seems they were anxious to get meal service done as quickly as possible.\n\nThe flight attendants were friendly on boarding but we hardly saw them after the meal service. No mid-flight snacks.\n\nPlane left and arrived on time.\n\nService was definitely not premium.",
                    "An above average experience but far from the best. Decent catering, good inflight entertainment in a modern A350. Crew were as polite as before, but they do expect you to ask for more nowadays instead of being offered as in pre-Covid. No more pre-meal snack or drink service. The flight was not full yet the crew seemed to be in rush during the meal service, we had to ask for coffee after the meal when they were collecting trays instead of being offered by crew, which is a strange service downgrade from pre-Covid, not only on this flight but also my return flight on SQ325. No more hot towel or printed menu, understandably due to Covid. But it is good to see that they don't put all pillows and blankets on the seats anymore to cut waste, they do give you if you need.",

                    "I flew Singapore Airlines after a while and soon realised the star rated airline is moving towards a budget airline. Their world class service levels have come down significantly. The time to load the aircraft, cabin service, food and beverage services were notably lower. However I must mention the two aircrafts I flew A350  and  B787 had very smooth ride, had less noise and cabin space was much better. My expectation was a world class service once they had and now they SA is pretty much in par with Malaysian, SriLankan airlines.",

The check-in documents confirmed our reserved seating for return journey. Two weeks later at Penang airport we were allocated seating separate from each other. Our reserved seating had been given to two other passengers on our holiday tour who had not reserved seating. Again on our flight from Singapore to Heathrow our reserved seating was given to the same two passengers and we were given seats at the back by the toilets ???? However we must praise the cabin crew. Nothing was too much trouble for them. They were wonderful.",

                    "Unfortunately, I am leaving a one-star review for Singapore Airlines, despite my on-plane experience being great (flight crew were friendly and helpful, food was good, etc. no complaints there). \n\nHowever, I had transferred 220,000 AMEX points to Singapore Airlines in order to book a business class ticket (as you might know, this has a cash equivalent of at minimum several thousand dollars). The way many of their flights work, is you must waitlist the seat and then you will be allowed to book it if nobody pays cash for the seat. So, I also booked an economy seat for myself in case business ended up filling up (you don't get notified until close to your departure date). \n\nWhen I arrived to the airport on my travel day, I was informed that my business class ticket had gone through as there were 10 seats available in business class on my flight. However, after about an hour of deliberation, and right before I was set to board - I was informed that I would actually not be able to sit in business class. What gives? I rolled with it - but, now I have a couple hundred thousand points trapped in Singapore that I seemingly can't use. If there is available space on the flight and I have the points, why can't I use them? Isn't that the whole point? \n\nI've been in touch with Singapore Airlines customer service but they've not been helpful at all. I've only received barely comprehensible responses (I understand that English may not be everyone's first language but would expect that a global company could have a strong English speaker respond to emails where necessary) that don't try to find any middle ground with me or admit any fault on behalf of the airline. It's really just a 'sorry about that, but no we won't let you take your points out of Singapore and this is your fault' ... this is all to say, if you don't want your hard-earned credit card points going to waste, transfer them to another airline!",
                    "Singapore Airlines A350-900 medium-haul aircraft is fitted with two cabins with 40 Business Class seats and 263 Economy Class seats. The 40 seats in Business Class are split into two sections, with 28 seats in the forward cabin, the larger cabin and 12 seats in the smaller rear cabin. The 1-2-1 seat configuration in Singapore Airlines’ regional Business Class product gives all passengers direct aisle access.\n\nThere are three lavatories, one located up front right behind the cockpit and another two between the two Business Class sections, serving all 40 passengers in Business Class. Singapore Airlines differentiates its Business Class lavatories from Economy Class by fitting them with brown leather backsplashes on the bulkhead. Singapore Airlines is one of the few airlines that packs its lavatories with amenities for guests’ convenience.\n\nSingapore Airlines regional Business Class seats have a seat pitch of 60″ and measure 28″ wide, providing its passengers with excellent legroom and enhanced privacy despite not having a door, thanks to the cacoon seat design. Singapore Airlines regional Business Class seats feature a 180° lie-flat bed. The seats come with several handy modes programmed into the seat control buttons on the side of the seat. Besides the seat controls, Singapore Airlines also included light controls and attendant call buttons on the touch-panelled seat control buttons.\n\npops out in its storage mode, which is half the size of the table. Passengers who do not need the large table can use it in its storage mode. The seat table folds out to its dining mode, which is twice the size of its storage mode. The seat table does not feel wobbly and is perfect for dining and working on a 16″ laptop. Under the IFE screen is a footwell, which is meant for passengers to stretch their feet into when the seat is deployed in its bed mode. Singapore Airlines fully used the space under the footwell by leaving it empty to double up as a space to stow carry-on or for passengers to place their shoes.\n\nThere is no lack of storage space on Singapore Airlines’ regional Business Class seats. There is a small cabinet at the side of each side for passengers to stow smaller items like mobile phones and passports. The small sliding door installed at the cabinet ensures the items inside remain secure and out of sight. Within the cabinet, passengers can find an international power socket and two USB charging outlets, making it very convenient for passengers to get juice for their devices. A hook next to the cabinet creates space for passengers to hang the headphones provided by Singapore Airlines when not in use. Singapore Airlines designed the space by the cabinet as a side table, which doubles up as a cocktail table, for passengers to place small items on. I thought the biggest flaw with the Singapore Airlines regional Business Class seats was the placement of the seat pocket. The seat pocket is placed at the lower corner of the seat on the back of the seat in front. Passengers wanting to access the seat pocket must unbuckle their seat belts and stretch for it. The seat pocket seems to be meant only for Singapore Airlines to place in-flight magazines and safety cards as it is too shallow (and tight) to fit in anything else.\n\nSingapore Airlines fits its Business Class with a large 18″ LED touchscreen TV. The LED TV can be tilted downwards so passengers can still watch the numerous options on KrisWorld lying down on the flatbed mode of the seat. The entertainment options on KrisWorld are laid out in an intuitive menu for passengers to browse and select from hundreds of shows, from the latest blockbuster movies to TV shows and even games. KrisWorld can be accessed via the touchscreen function on the TV or via the mobile phone, like IFE controller found under the seat controls at the side of the seat. Singapore Airlines supplies noise-cancelling headphones to its Business Class passengers. These headphones effectively cancel out the ambient noise from the aircraft cabin and are comfortable to put on. Business Class passengers are given free wifi to use onboard. \n\nSingapore Airlines does not offer its signature “Book the Cook” service for flights originating from Bangkok. I opted for the Indonesian Fried Rice, while my friend chose the Pan Fried Salmon. Of the three courses of the meal served, I thought only the appetiser was tasty. The Indonesian Fried Rice I had was disappointing in taste and presentation. I thought the presentation of the meal did not enhance its appetising appeal, the fried rice looked haphazardly splattered on the china, and the vegetables looked like a mess. The grilled chicken tasted blend, the fried rice tasted like plain steamed rice, and the vegetable was overpowered with spiciness. The sticky pudding dessert looked like some mouldy bread, but I tasted the dessert nonetheless. The pudding was too sweet for my liking that I had to wash the taste with Coke. My friend also commented the Pan Fried Salmon he opted for tasted bland and dry.\n\nService on Singapore Airlines Business Class was exceptional. The excellent service started the moment I boarded the aircraft. Cabin crew offered me pre-departure drinks, introducing Singapore Airlines’ latest cocktail, Bellini. When told I do not drink too much, the cabin crew offered me another glass of orange juice in case I was not too fond of the cocktail. Before taking off, the cabin crew – Stephanie stopped by every seat under her charge to introduce herself to all the passengers she would be taking care of during the flight. Despite a full flight, I find cabin crews onboard made an effort to check in with passengers if we required anything else.\n\nTowards the end of the flight, a passenger sitting across from me started to make noise about the requirement to submit an online arrival card in Singapore. He kicked up a ruckus that the ground staff did not inform him of this requirement. Instead of brushing him aside, I witness Stephanie patiently helping the passenger fill out an online form while her colleagues stand in for her to conduct pre-landing checks. I overheard Stephaine volunteering to share her mobile data with him when we landed to ensure the passenger could enter Singapore smoothly. Despite it being the passenger’s fault for not checking the immigration requirements, Stephaine handled the situation with much patience and professionalism.",
                    "Our first-time flying Singapore Airlines Business Class. I honestly could not fault the entire experience with Singapore Airlines from the online booking experience thru to the arrival in Singapore (We took advantage of pre-ordering our meal). Online check-in, no problem. Bag Drop no problem and an extremely helpful staff member who provided extremely useful pre boarding information. Boarding, no issues. Business Class cabin crew were excellent. The flight on the A350 aircraft was nice and smooth. On arrival in Singapore once we cleared all the formalities, we only had couple minutes wait for our baggage. We would have no hesitation flying with Singapore Airlines again.",
                    "Flying on SIA as previous experiences with them were great. Very attentive, clean facilities friendly staff. Once onboard was delighted to note that I had an empty seat beside me. Within minutes an attendant asked if I would like an upgrade. Needless to say I leapt at the opportunity. I was ushered to an exit row seat...57C on Airbus 800. Over the next hour I was constantly kicked, knocked and tripped over by people going to the loo or using the space to stretch. When I put up the tv screen, pulled out from somewhere under the seat, it made the space between me and the opposite seat even narrower. I noted that the lady who had vacated said seat was now seated with a man in the previously empty seat and there was only one other free seat in the plane, middle of the centre row. When I expressed my displeasure the passenger next to me explained that the couple's son had been in an accident and they were flying back urgently to be with him. The woman I had swapped with, his mum,was quite upset and needed her husband's support. I was glad to help BUT felt I'd been put in an awkward position of not being able to refuse the request. Just be aware that this seat is not an upgrade and in all honesty should be removed. The staff clearly knew it well as they had a nifty little step to get around it without banging into it. Just saying SIA, something to look at.",
                    "Departure delayed by 1 hour due to late arrival & taxiing half way there !  Could have had an extra 1hour in bed \n787 metal was excellent with individual window seat, however, nowhere to be found were the operating instructions for the seat etc. Staff were somewhat brusque when answering questions. Never found the missing armrest until our next flight.\nAV was excellent.  Food & wine as to be expected on SQ,  starting  with the ubiquitous satay.",
                    "I have a lot of experience flying in different airlines in business class. I rate Singapore airline as a weak 3.\nBad seats in the business class, they do not fold out enough, it is difficult to stretch your legs, you fly crooked the whole flight. Business class, ticket costs $5,000!\nVery small selection of food, portions are small, the food is so-so.\nSpecial complaint about the organization of the flight. Departure from New York at 10 am. At 1 in the afternoon they turned off the lights on the whole plane and the whole flight we were in the dark the whole flight, and this is 18 hours! I didn't pay for business class ticket to fly in the dark during the day! This is unnatural.\nSingapore Airlines - never again!",
                    "This is the 3rd time we've flown with Singapore airline and we still enjoy their service. The flight out of Brisbane was on time. We didn't have reserved seats and were given 67J&K and we didn't have anyone else in our 3 seat row so we spread out which was nice. The service by the crew is always professional. They served the meal then the lights were dimmed. They constantly bring water and refreshments around so we kept our fluids up and didn't get dehydrated. The Kris inflight entertainment system is great with heaps to chose from. They have some of the latest movies out so it was nice to watch them. It was only a 7hr flight so nice and short for the 1st hop. The plane landed on time in Singapore to a warm barmy night. Cant recommend Singapore airlines enough.",
                    "Really impressed by the service I got during my flight back from Phnom Penh to Jakarta via Singapore. I like their green and safe concept of in-flight meals. They also provide us with sanitary kit.",
                    "Lounge : SilverKris Lounge\nVery disappointing. A lounge at Changi which provides access to every Star Alliance Business Class passenger , is bound to get overcrowded. Despite the multi-million dollar 'renovation' , the seating plan was not carefully considered. We were lucky enough to \"grab\" a sofa in a silent corner of the lounge , but we could see everyone who came after us struggling to find even a basic seat.\n\nBoarding : The biggest flaw at SIN ( and CMB / KUL / etc. ) is their security check policy , which happens right at the boarding gate. This forces everyone to proceed to the gate atleast an hour in advance , and get locked up in a small glass enclosure until boarding. P.s.- No priority lanes for security.\n\nSeat / Layout :\nThe Business Class cabin on board this 737-8 MAX has 10 LIE-FLAT seats arranged in 3 rows as 2-2 , 1-1 & 2-2. Very comfortable indeed. Seat controls worked perfectly fine.\n\nService : Very professional & courteous crew.\n\nFood & Beverage : Used the 'Book The Cook' service.  'Lobster Thermidor' was great. Loved the 'Boon Tong Kee Chicken Rice' as well.\n\nArrival : Luggage did arrive on a 'Priority' basis.",
                    "Flew business class Syd to Sin and first class Sin to Syd.\nAs is often the way there was not a big difference between the 2 TBH even though I had a A380 \"suite\" -  its still just a bed!\nBoth flights had a similar bar but in 1st I did try the famous lobster thermidore and can confirm its excellent.\nThe difference with SIA is their incredible cabin staff.  If you need drinks they are there.  If you want quiet they know and are not there.  It may sound simple but its something rare and totally beyond the comprehension of other long haul airlines such as Qantas.  They know they are good and their default action is attentiveness unless you so desire.  Amazing.  Silver Kris Lounge was very crowded which is perhaps a good thing to see that they are getting busy again.  GO SIA!!",
                    "This was a terrible flight.  A tiny business class bed, no sheets/covers, horrible pillow, terrible covers Zthat were crumpled and shabby.  We left at midnight and we’re offered food.  We were woken at about 5.00 and offered food but I couldn’t get a cup of coffee and when I did it was cold…really cold.  Hey friend in coach couldn’t get a bottle of water, food was ok, just… and a sweet white wine…\nThis plane should have been burned straight after COVID.  The service is NOT what we would expect from Singapore airlines !  Take this tip… avoid SG airlines",
                    "Flew LAX-SIN-BWN (Brunei) on award ticket. Reasonably user-friendly website - able to book seat, special meal, etc. without hiccups. Smooth online check-in (boarding pass only at the airport due to document check). Very quick airport check-in. Smooth boarding process. Comfortable economy seats (better than average). Entertainment system with wide selection of movies. Free wifi, which worked well. USB ports and power sockets at each seat on the LAX-SIN flight. On the short SIN-BWN flight there was a USB port only, which was very weak and didn't charge my phone. Special meals were better than average. Both flights arrived early.\nThe only thing I didn't like was the annoying music played on board the LAX-SIN flight for over 30 min prior to landing.",
                    "Recently flew from Manchester to Sydney and return.  The outbound flight was over an hour late departing meaning that our layover time in Singapore was reduced to the bare minimum meaning we had to rush between planes.  On the return journey the flight from Sydney landed at T2 with the next flight leaving from T3.  With no transfer help offered it took nearly an hour to do the transfer meaning once again no use of the Lounge.  Now to the seating.  On the Singapore to Sydney and return leg the seats were great, comfortable, lie flat seats.  However, on the Manchester to Singapore and return leg if you wanted to put your feet up they are at an angle.  Also the seat is not lie flat, if you want to lay down the air crew have to convert it to a bed but you are still laying diagonally, so not very comfortable.  The service cannot be faulted although the food wasn't to my liking.",
                    "We travelled Premium Economy on 6th Feb from Auckland on a 777 Aircraft of Singapore airlines and found the cabin layout very poor, ,in fact the lack of segregation meant that we could have saved money by travelling Economy. The food was poor, service very poor, in fact when served a meal it was lacking two significant components and while staff noted they failed to rectify as promised. The tea we asked for, note not offered, was serve red in a cardboard cup and with powered milk.\n\nThe follow on flight from Singapore to London on 6/7th Feb on 380, had a better segregated area, but food still poor. The breakfast offer was limited and basic Chicken and Rice was offered with alternative of Bread Pudding, sausage, beans and mushrooms. Not relative to chant base for a flight into UK. \n\nThese flights along with the out going flights displayed that Singapore Airlines Premium Economy service is not worth any more than basic economy.",
                    "As an expat living in Australia for this last 30 years, my wife and I have travelled this route a number of times (as well as many other destinations on business and pleasure). However, we treated ourselves to business class this time, and must say that we were made to feel like royalty.\n\nAside from all the usual trimmings of business class flights (lounge access, express security and boarding), the check-in staff and airline crew were absolutely marvellous and constantly looked after us. Our comfort and wellbeing was clearly their priority. The preselected three-course meals were on par with a first-rate restaurant, and they had a great choice of top shelf spirits and cocktails (which needless to say we sampled a great many).\n\nFurthermore, I left my iPad on the final return leg (I blame the 16yo single malt scotch 😊) and was contacted by their cleaning contractor (dnata) on the day of my return to say it was found. Excellent service all round. The only major drawback, is that it is now going to be very difficult to ever do that trip again on economy (as we usually do), now that we’ve tasted this 😁\n\nHighly recommended!",
                    "They didn't serve hand towels when on board. No salads n fruits. No dessert as well. Instead gave you a walls ice cream. They provide reuse blanket from Emirates. (See photos). \nPilot skill was terrible with a heavy drop down landing. And the price is expensive. Overall is overpriced flight",
                    "Flew from Manchester to Singapore recently on an A350 in Premium Economy and we both agree that this service has gone rapidly downhill since our last flight with then in PE.\nThere does not seem to much legroom and the seats are uncomfortable especially on a 13 hour flight.\nFood was not good either, very poor selection and the 'book the cook' service is not available on this sector which was disappointing.\nDid go their offices in Singapore to see how much it would cost one way from Singapore to Manchester. \n12,000 sgd!!! Roughly £8,000!!! We declined that.\nWe have always used Singapore Airlines each time we have gone to Singapore and West Australia and been a krisflyer member for 25 years,  they were not bothered, all they want to do is make as much money as they can.\nWill use another airline on the future  possibly Qatar as a relative using them and say they are very good and accommodating.",
                    "SIA used to be the measuring stick and to which other airlines would have aspired\nA round trip Adelaide to Vietnam and return through Changi with a family…no warm towel or welcome drink, absolutely terrible food culminating in Penne pasta out of a cardboard box. Uber eats was constantly!!\nOn board service all but non existent \nI have a paid Business Class fare to Europe in July but unless the airline lifts its game significantly then Middle East airlines will get my business in future \nSorry SIA but you are no longer the benchmark",
                    "Singapore airlines has become a disgrace to its legacy. The airline was once one of the best experiences a person could have traveling but has now devolved to the level of a poor US airline like United or American. They charge exorbitant fare and get away with it while continuously decreasing the value of their service. Being a member of the airline comes with little to no real benefit any longer. The customer service is terrible, the attitude of the airline employees is significantly worse, and the experience on the whole has become one that makes one want to find alternatives. If I am going to be treated like, I would be fine to fly a lower cost carrier. In the end, if not for the privileges it gets for being the national carrier, it would quickly be out of business. It is time to focus on its every day passengers rather than spending all of you investment trying to one up other airlines on the rich, first class passengers.",
                    "Singapore Airlines Business Class offers an unparalleled flying experience. It's a blend of luxury, comfort, and exceptional service that transforms travel into an indulgence. For anyone looking to fly from San Francisco to Singapore, I wholeheartedly recommend Singapore Air Business Class. It's not just a flight; it's a journey that celebrates the art of flying, setting a benchmark for what air travel should be.\n\nWorld-Class Service: The Flight Attendants' Touch\n\nThe heart and soul of Singapore Airlines are its flight attendants, and the crew on \nSingapore Flight 33 exemplified this perfectly. The world-class service began from the moment I stepped on board, greeted by smiles that felt genuinely welcoming. A special thanks to Victor (IFM), Tan Wee Song (CS), Lionel (LS), Howard (FS), and Scarlette (FSS) who went above and beyond to ensure my comfort and satisfaction throughout the flight. Their professionalism, attention to detail, and warm demeanor made me feel valued and well taken care of.\n\nThe Culinary Experience: A Gastronomic Delight\n\nOne of the standout features of Singapore Air's Business Class is its culinary offerings. The menu choices, including Lobster Thermidor, Seared Sea Bass, and Grilled Filet Mignon, were not just meals but culinary experiences that rivaled some of the Michelin Star restaurants I've dined in. Each dish was prepared with meticulous attention to flavor, presentation, and quality, making dining one of the highlights of the flight.\n\nComfort Redefined: The Business Class Seat\n\nThe Business Class seat on Singapore Air was a haven of comfort. The spacious, fully-reclining seat provided a perfect environment for relaxation and sleep. With ample legroom, adjustable lighting, and a range of seating positions, it was easy to find the perfect setting for every part of the journey. The privacy and quietness of the cabin added to the sense of exclusivity, making it feel like a personal retreat in the sky.\n\nIn-Flight Entertainment: A World of Choices\n\nThe in-flight entertainment system was another aspect where Singapore Airlines shined. The wide selection of movies, TV shows, music, and games meant that there was never a dull moment. The screen was large and high-resolution, ensuring a great viewing experience, while the noise-canceling headphones provided by the airline allowed me to immerse myself in the entertainment without any distractions.\n\nAttention to Detail: Small Touches that Matter\n\nWhat sets Singapore Airlines apart are the small touches that show their commitment to excellence. The amenity kit provided was thoughtfully equipped with high-quality essentials. The restrooms were consistently clean and well-stocked, reflecting the crew’s dedication to maintaining a comfortable environment. Even the cabin lighting was adjusted to mimic the time of day, helping to reduce jet lag.\n\nThe Lounge: A Pre-Flight Indulgence\n\nBefore boarding, I had the pleasure of visiting the exclusive Singapore Airlines lounge. The lounge was a tranquil space, offering a variety of seating areas, delicious food, and an array of beverages. It was the perfect place to relax and prepare for the flight, adding another layer of luxury to the overall travel experience.\n\nA Commitment to Safety and Cleanliness\n\nIn an era where health and safety are paramount, Singapore Airlines demonstrated a rigorous commitment to cleanliness and safety protocols. The cabin was immaculate, and the crew took great care to ensure that all health guidelines were followed without compromising on service quality.\n\nThe Singapore Airlines Business Class Experience\n\nHaving traveled to Asia in First and Business Class for the past 25 years, I can confidently say that Singapore Airlines is among the best. Their attention to every aspect of the flight experience, from service to comfort to dining, sets them apart. The crew on Flight 33, with their exceptional service and dedication, played a pivotal role in making this one of the best flights I’ve ever experienced.\n\nAnticipating the Next Journey\n\nAs I disembark from Singapore Air, I find myself actually looking forward to my next 16-hour flight with them. It’s rare to find an airline that not only meets but exceeds expectations, turning what could be a tedious long-haul flight into a memorable journey.",
                    "SIA airfare prices seem to increase dramatically whilst their service seems to be declining and I feel that they are no longer the world class airlines they are known for. The cabin crew/Flight attendants services during my flights were ok (average) but in NO WAY world class standards. I noticed now The WORST is SIA service ground staff at Changi Airport and Terminal 3 Haneda Tokyo check in counters. The staff seem incompetent and disinterested in any assistance.",
                    "Poor , very  POOR.\nHow the HELL do Singapore airlines receive the NO 1 Accolade in airlines. I sat in aile 59 , and rexpereiced BACK PAIN,  that I have never expereinced before. i reported to the Air Host, Male . who was not interested, and spoke to the Air Hostess , Lady, who took down my particulars. I requested a better fitting seat, but was rebuffed. That alone was only the start, the food was AWFUL.. Sorry singapore airlines, you are POOR.\nFly at your PERIL.\nKind regards,\nNorman Russell",
                    "SIA is sinking day by day. The contact service is an utter disgrace and useless. Upon boarding,  no one greeted us as being Elite members nor was there much interaction between the crew and passengers. \nNo menu no warm towels no welcome drinks. \nThe meal service took so long and people wanted to sleep.\n The quality of the food was really very mediocre and no comparison to the lovely meals I have had in the past. \nWifi was an utter failure and barely worked for 1 minute. \nNot a word of apology from the captain regarding the delay nor were any updates given to the passengers. A real failure",
                    "Since my last review in 2018 and with the pandemic situation now under control, I have initiated my traveling again. \n\nThis time, I have opted to travel to London with my family. I have decided to travel via Singapore Airlines again and I must say it was a right decision. The in-flight service was excellent. The staff in attendance, in particular Yvonne Chua was indeed very resourceful, accommodating and service oriented to the needs of the passengers. \n\nThe flight was smooth and comfortable with our meals well taken care off, even though I have certain diet restrictions. The stewardess (Yvonne Chua) was very careful in serving what I was able to consume by checking with my family members before they serve it to me. \n\nThe impression I had is that Singapore Airlines has been very consistent in maintaining its high standard of service. The announcement over the PA system by the Captain was very clear and precise. He even announced that this was his last flight as pilot upon landing as he was retiring. The passengers acknowledged and clapped after his announcement.\n\ni believe there were quite a number of Senior Citizens on the plane. It would be great to have a variety of oldies in terms of movies and music/songs for selection.\nFood wise is acceptable but could be better. The Cabin Head did make an effort to explain in terms of how the food was prepared. My family members loved the satay provided and they did not hesitate to give us a second helping when we requested (unlike other airline refusing outright).\n\nAll in all, an enjoyable flight with the flight steward and stewardess gave us a helping hand by taking some photographs of us for memory when we boarded.",
                    "Recently the main carrier SIA has resorted to collect fees for seat selection.  This only happened in budget airlines.  We traveled in family and the usual expensive fees did not come with seat selection.  The wings of the aircraft was even scarier and frightening.  Full with patches and my child thought it was a window view of islands.  Good luck to you if you still choose SIA now!  Quality dropped a lot.",
                    "had previously flown with Singapore Airlines and had a positive experience, so I booked again. I have been extremely (!!!) disappointed. \n\nI do not recommend flying Singapore Airlines if you have any dietary intolerances, requirements or allergies. Before flying: (1) I requested a gluten intolerant meal; (2) I contacted Singapore Airlines through the app; and (3) I also checked that I was all sorted for gluten free upon checking in at Sydney Airport. \n\nDespite the staff member at the airport providing confirmation, the staff on the second flight (from Singapore to Paris) told me that they had no gluten intolerant meal for me onboard or any record of the request. I then went 13 hours without any substantial food, as I had only brought muesli bars with me (between the initial flight of 8 hours and then a 13 hour layover, I couldn’t bring much else). The stewards offered me a vegetarian meal as an alternative, but this had barley etc (so not suitable). \n\nThe crew onboard and at the airport were both very nice, so that is the only plus I would give to Singapore Airlines. I felt like they were pleasant and tried to make the experience better. However, when contacting Singapore Airlines via phone some weeks before to enquire about re-routing my flight, I had to wait on hold for quite a long time when I just wanted confirmation as to whether I could change the flight at all. It turns out that they have to manually calculate re-routing the flights, which is fair - however, I kept just asking for them to confirm whether it could be done and couldn’t seem to get a simple answer. \n\nIn my subjective opinion, I felt that the seats were more uncomfortable than other similar airlines. The gentleman in front of me on the second flight put his seat right back, so the steward assisted me to find a temporary new seat which was kind of him. Again, the staff at check-in and onboard were lovely and the only plus I would give to the airline. \n\nI have since contacted Singapore Airlines about the experience and got a very generic short email noting their  sincere apologies and a query about whether I needed to select gluten free on the flight back. I replied in more detail, and have since received a reply addressed to somebody completely different (definitely not me - a completely different surname) saying that they already booked a gluten intolerant meal for my inbound flight (which is contrary to their previous email). \n\nI would never personally book with Singapore Airlines again and am absolutely dreading the flight back. ",
                    "Extremely unusual time to fly as we  needed an exemption to fly out of Australia from the government.  We obtained one as working in Tokyo for the year as teachers.  \nThe check in procedure does take a lot longer as more paperwork and phone calls are needed to check if you are allowed to travel.   The staff were excellent in explaining the procedure as they are working with very few numbers.\nThe flight had 40 people only, so lots of room and yes we had 3 seats each.  The service of meals and beverages  was done very quickly and efficiently.\nChangi airport was like a ghost town with most shops closed and all passengers are walked/transported to a transit zone until your next flight is ready.  You are then walked in single file or transported to your next flight,  so very strange as at times their seemed be more workers in PPE gear than passengers.\nThe steps we went through at Narita were extensive, downloading apps, fill in paperwork and giving a saliva sample to test for covid 19.  It took about 2 hours to get through the steps and we only sat down for maybe 10 minutes at the last stop to get back your covid results.  The people involved were fantastic and we were lucky that we were numbers two and three in the initial first line up, but still over 2 hours it took so be aware.  We knew we were quick as the people picking us up told us we were first out.",
                    "Heading home after an overseas trip and stay in Singapore and Singapore Airlines the perfect service to conclude our holiday. Seated in 49b & C, comfortable, great entertainment as per previous flights, excellent cabin crew, both male and female and informative from the cockpit when relevant. World class airline.",
                    "As a fairly frequent traveller, I always look forward to peace of mind when doing so, especially as the world is trying to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. Singapore Airlines gives me that much needed peace of mind, without worries about inefficiency or poor service etc. I really enjoyed my two-way flight between Singapore and New York. The food was amazing on board and the service was excellent as expected. I look forward to flying with Singapore Airlines again.",
                    "Wonderful airlines. Lounges were fantastic. The attention to detail by the staff was impeccable. They were particularly good with my 14, 12 and 10 year old. They knew all the kids by name. The food was astounding and the selection in business class was great. The seat in the 777-300 from Singapore to London was very roomy and easy to sleep on. The seats in the  A350 was a bit cramped and difficult to sleep in, especially around the legs. Only thing was the decor in both the planes were a bit dated and worn. I think it may need to be updated. Overall fantastic airlines and would certainly fly them again.",
                    "All crews didn't help at all even I had 1 year old baby \nThe worst experience for his first flight \nNot welcome at all",
                    "I specifically chose to fly with Singapore Airlines due to my positive experiences in their Economy Class from years ago. Having explored premium Economy options with various airlines since then, I was eager to give Singapore Airlines another try, considering their esteemed reputation and my previous impressions.\n\nRegrettably, the experience fell short of my expectations. Both legs of the journey, from Zürich to Singapore and back, featured uncomfortably cold cabin conditions. While the staff were friendly and hospitable, I didn't sense the distinctive Singapore Airlines ambiance I remembered.\n\nWhat disappointed me even more was the absence of an amenity kit. Additionally, having to share toilets with Economy passengers was less than ideal, resulting in lengthy queues reminiscent of standard Economy travel. The meal service was identical to what one would receive in Economy. While the privilege of checking in and boarding ahead of Economy passengers is granted in Premium Economy, I questioned whether it justified the higher price point. Personally, I found that the added value, aside from extra legroom, didn't justify the cost.\n\nI must admit that Lufthansa and ANA offer significantly superior Premium Economy services. They provide access to lounges and offer amenity kits (in the case of ANA). Even LOT surpasses Singapore Airlines in terms of attentive staff.\n\nCathay Pacific also outshines Singapore Airlines in their Premium Economy offering, excelling in terms of food quality, attentive service, and the provision of a modest amenity kit.",
                    "Incessant reminders to wear a mask and pull it up over your nose. All while being asked to share a medical exemption if you don't (which is illegal by the way to ask for and can be kept private between yourself and Dr. if you wish, like any medical information).\n\nNot to mention the masks they hand out are completely ineffective as are 99% of all masks used (cloth, N95, surgical). Just search on duck duck go, 150 studies proving masks are completely ineffective and often increase transmission (don't get your info / commentary from news sources / gov sites). \n\nSo this political issue, passed onto airlines to mandate is deplorable with no leadership by a private comoany nor evidence based logic. Just wear it and be good. Just because they tell you to, doesn't mean it's right or lawful because it's not. \n\nMeals also took forever to be collected so sat for way too long while everyone just wanted to get back to sleep.\n\nOne positive, ran on time.",
                    "An amazing flight from Sydney to Singapore on Singapore Airlines A350 wide bodied airliner. From the ease of check in and boarding to a fantastic on board flight crew this flight could not have been better. The meal service was good as well as the drink selection. Seat back entertainment was more than adequate for the 8 hour flight. Overall a great flight and good to see that the service has not changed in our post Covid world.",
                    "I had high expectations, but I was not disappointed. Incredible crew, thank you Rebecca and Juanita taking care of me so well. The seat is 30 inches wide (10 more than most) and you have a side table that is at the right height with several storage compartments. The seat side wall does reduce the visibility out the window somewhat, but this was not a big negative. The seat was very comfortable as long as I found the right sitting position or it it could have felt hard. For sleeping you do need to angel yourself as your feet will go in to the footwell on one side of the seat in front of you. \nAs for the ground staff, I believe that they were all subcontractors so I could not expect them to live up to the standard of the inflight crew.",

Excellent service!",

Shame of SQ. It is definitely not a great way to fly. I would rather fly with Thai Airways. At least they know how to hired the thai not like SQ gives the priority hiring to foreigners especially of the hypocrisy service that was protrayed during the filght. Keep on hiring foreigners and this will be the result,  even your countryman also do not wants you to represent us. SHAMELESS. Oh does Singapore Airlines even knows what shameful is . Well it doesn't and still want to represent Singapore till Singaporean are ashamed even when mentioning your brand.",

Really good chicken and pasta on this 1 1/2 flight.  We had a 3 hour layover in Singapore and then off on a 16 hour flight to SFO.  The flight was long but stqff were professional - the seats were comfortable - my wife and I had window and aisle with seat between us, and food was good.  Lots of entertainment choices on flight. Dim lighting allowed me to sleep and adequate seat pitch (compared to United) allowed me to arrive in one piece.",
                    "My check-n at CPT AP took the best of minutes at the Business Class Counter because the agent had to refer back and forth to her supervisor.\nThe only good thing about this so called PREMIUM Y Class is the inflight entertainment. In flight service from CPT to JNB was friendly and passengers addressed by name with a smile ( behind the masks ) After a 90 minutes delay out of JNB the so called ‘service’ was non existing and I think the flight attendant thought she did me a favour to NOT offer a drink before meal service on a 10 hrs flight, the ‘’food’’ same as in Y Class was below any  standards, wine served out of a half filled plastic glass with no offer for refill etc etc and all of this without a single smile, friendly word and no attempt at all to at least try to give some sort of service. This reflected the lack of attitude of her inflight Manager who equally tried her best to ignore her passengers by talking over their heads. \nThroughout the flight service the amount of plastic used is staggering....\nWith 90 minutes delay there was not a single word of apology from the cockpit , Never mind this annoying passenger having missed his connection.\nSQ never again if I can avoid it now that I realised what happened to the ever smiling Singapore Girl.....",

Staff at Manchester airport were very helpful. My advice is to take a sandwich with you! I did see someone going to the back who was served something but I think you have to ask.",
                    "Phenomenon service is an understatement to this airline.\nI have taken many trips with many different airlines over part decades but Singapore airlines definitely give me a different perspective what an airline or airline services should be.\nThey are very attentive, attention to details and very professional. On this trip, we took some of our trips with business class and some with economy. Both class provided exceptional services.\nOne of my meals, from Singapore back to Newark, steak with oxtails and vegetables was one of my most delicious meals to remember. Man oh man, it was one of the best meals I have ever had on air.  I usually have low regards for foods on air due to the atmospheric and pressure charges and taste buds changes but they managed make one of the most delicious steak that I have ever tasted in my entire life.  By the way, I'm a steal lover. They executed my steak dish to almost perfection. The steak was medium, my favorite. The shredded oxtails was tasty, tendered and melt in your mouth. The veggies were perfectly cooked.  One of the gentlemen gave me two different glasses of wines afterwards,n per my request, and they were great also. I gave my honest compliment to the gentleman who served my wines  and he brought the chef over to thank my compliment.  What a service!  I regret I didn't take the picture of my steak plate. 🤦‍♂️\nHighly recommend anyone to use Singapore airlines.\nGreat job Singapore airlines and the team behind the food services. I have heard so much about you over the years but this was the first time I witnessed it. Better than I expected.\nKeep up a great work.",

                    "Flew Brisbane to London, upgrading to Premium Economy Singapore to London (it was not available Brisbane to Singapore) Very disappointing, seats were ok, more leg room than economy but not particularly comfortable. There was no difference in the service or meals as passengers flying economy class. Toilets were also shared with economy class and usually long queues. Not worth the extra money. It would be cheaper to pay for extra leg room in economy class.",
                    "Excellent flight Singapore/Hong Kong on the A380 and seated in 45B & C. Great boarding experience, efficient, helpful at the gate and on board. Wifi and great selection for entertainment for the four-hour meal flight. Enjoyed the inflight service, drinks and tasty meal. Baggage available when we passed through immigration. Easy to acknowledge SIA as the World's Number 1 airline.",
                    "A great experience once again with Singapore Airline. We were in transit. The boarding was very orderly. On board service was excellent. The crew was very helpful and polite.

She is also vegetarian. \nUnfortunately singapore airlines cannot cater for gluten free meals that are also vegetarian. \nThey are also unable to give us complete list of indgredients of the meals, so there is no way we can’t check ourselves. When we call customer service they are unable to call kitchen or re-clarify list of ingredients on the menu. \nFor some reason they assume that if you are coeliac you can’t be vegetarian. \nSo disappointing especially by its customer service as they can’t help with my simple queries of list indgredients on the menu.

                    "I was really excited to try Singapore Airlines as it was on my list of airlines to try in business class. The pictures are amazing, and the pods you have (we flew on an A380-800) were very nice with lots of room. However, the seats are very uncomfortable (compared to business class in Lufthansa, United, and Qatar). I put the mattress pad on and that didn't really help. I wasn't able to get much sleep on the flight, and of course, start to Google and found similar complaints. \nThe food was fantastic as was the service which made the flight a little bit easier. \nMy only other issue was the Wifi. You can purchase for the entirety of the flight. You can either purchase a data bundle, limited to 100 or 200 Mb, or a block of time, up to three hours being the longest at $15.99. So if you want to work you need to plan accordingly or you might pay >$60 for a full flight of internet. \nI will avoid for future flights if possible. ",
                    "The expectations for a five-star airline are always high and this review reflects our high expectations vs the reality we experienced on our recent flights BOM-SIN-BKK:\n\nTHE PROS\n\n1 Cabin crew: highly motivated & upbeat. Excellent ambassadors of SIA.\n\nTHE CONS\n\n1 Aircraft B777W: a noisy aircraft (when sitting next to the engine, 18 A). Avoid!\n2 Seat: if you love sitting in an angled position during take-off and landing, go for it! The captain switched off the seatbelt sign 45 min into the flight due to heavy rains in India and 30 min before landing, a back ache as a result. The bed is comfortable, though, managed some 1-hour sleep on the flight.\n3 Meal: didn't book the cook. Very spicy ex-Mumbai.\n \nWhen flying a five-star airline and spending a small fortune after Covid-19 for the flights, the expectations are really high. Those were not met by SIA, unfortunately, partly due to the poor transit experience at Changi Airport (i.e. T2 under renovation, T2 lounge poor). SIA seems to be OK the air, but poor on the ground at present (T2 in particular). \n\nFive star? No, not at all. The cabin crew are absolutely great; the rest of the product leaves a lot to be desired (at T2 at least).",

Toilets - we had to walk half way back down the Economy cabin to queue for the toilet.  One toilet on the plane was not working.

After having a great meal at Turkish Airline’s lounge, we cannot helped but to compare how sad our own Krisflyer lounge at Changi has become! Food and cleanliness were just missing! Hardly any top up and food was pretty tasteless compared to Turkish airline’s lounge where fresh breads and cook to order live stations were well manned!\n\nWe tried several times to ‘book the cook’ and were not given that option. \n\nOn board the leading and more senior stewardess ( in green and purple) gave great service as usual, however, the junior stewardess in blue kebaya was just rushing and practically panicking up and down the aisle! For a moment I thought I was on Air France again! There was no grace and the nice touches of serving us on bended knees have all disappeared! \n\nBread had to be requested even after mains were served. Tea had to be requested too when desserts were provided. What happened to the satay too?! The route from Singapore to Istanbul had none. At least the Istanbul to Sin had some!! \n\nAnd the worst part was, when we landed at Changi airport, we discovered her luggage wheel went missing! Her Samsonite was damaged! After making the report, Changi has stated they will repair the luggage not replace it!!! So why did we have priority tags on luggage if the bags were going to be so badly mishandled?! \n\nWe really would like a replacement Samsonite\n\nAnd seriously, pls do review standards. It is not expensive to provide bed slippers automatically especially the route from Singapore ! Why are there double standards? The Singapore to Istanbul crew stated slippers and eye mask were now upon request only, while the Istanbul back to Singapore had all the usual amenites at the seat?\n\nWe used to be so proud and happy to fly our national carrier.

                    "The Singapore girl is as much as a wonder as a delight. Before I am excused of sexism, there were male FA,s in service as well. you can say that they are representative of the country as a whole - warm, hospitable, excellence in efficiency and execution and yes culturally some what sterile. Our journey began in the utter chaos and dysfunction of Bangalore, India's 5th metro city, and South Asia's Si Valley and supposedly the Indian metro with the highest median income. Since the SQ flight from KIA left at 11 pm or so, we were airport bound, a distance of ~ 40 km during evening peak hour. To avoid inner city traffic jams our driver took us through the \"back alleys\" to get as close as he could to the highway north of BNC area. Oh well! Check in was super smooth. A SQ baggage handler at check in moved our 4 bags from the trolleys to the conveyor belt and refused a thank you money. The international dep lounge used by most airline at KIA is a nice space but can do better. Hopefully the new T2 where all phoren flights will A/D may have a nicer version. The lounge food was OK, the gin tonic seemed too dilute etc and not sure if the lounge has a shower facility. Great staff and clean otherwise. Boarding for us was thru a common mid cabin gate as our seats were closer to the end of the section and occurred along with the Y passengers. The A350-900 J module was of the older variety and was not as plush as on the SIN-LAX sector. since the cabin crew had come in from SIN and were also doing the return leg, a bit of fatigue showed on their faces, entirely understandable. we departed on time with a flying time of approx 3.5 hrs. Food (somewhat aflatoon) by Sanjeev Kapoor was ok but could have been better? The best was the simple rice with thin sliced shallots and chilgoze. The Chianti was superb as per my sources. Arrival at Changi was a breeze. Now this is where the effortless efficiency of this city-state shows. Since we had an e passport and had completed the required form online, exit from immigration was contactless and took <1 minute thru 2 barrriers. We were at luggage claim well before our bags that showed up 10 mins later. getting a taxi was efffortless and the ride to the other end of the island was smooth. In the early morning brain fog, the chaos of India/Bengaluru, and Twighlight hours, all i could utter \"yeh kahaan aggaye hum yun hi saath chalte chalte\" (yeah my Rekha darling was with me). we arrived at our location with NO issues, drivers use the GPS from point A to B, and there is NO tipping culture for services anywhere in the Lion City. After our 4 day stay we returned to Changi T3 to board the LAX flight. You need to tell the taxi driver your class of service as entry gates are different for J/Y etc. Check in was smooth. contactless scan your PP, and you can headd to duty free or lounge/gate etc. The dedicated SQ lounge in our terminal is supposedly not as nice as others (must be older) but worked for us - all we needed was a safe secluded space to wait until boarding. Lounge food is nothing to write home about, the men's room had NO smell of piss, pee or phenyl, no buzzing insects,and were super clean (NO pubic hair littering the urinals). Our gate was a good 10 minute walk from the lounge. Security was at the gate it self, boarding was hassle free and the J cabin was superb on our A350-900. Clear differences in the business module were evident on the two sectors we flew.  The cabin staff, service  was warm and unobtrusive. if you are seated the cabin crew at times bent down to your eye level, who does that? In my 44 years of flying across continents the most recent such warmth was shown only by SWISS on the Zurich-DEL sector in an otherwise lack luster J hard product. The SQ J hard product had many storage bins, a reading light, a few indirect lights (in case you dont wish to use the overhead one) and the food served was the best i have had in any J cabin (my J experience is only 5 years, before that it was always Y). I am glad i had preordered a vegetarian meal - the onboard menu had no vegetarian option (quite unlike EU airlines that seem to include at least a pasta option). The IFE is OK, nothing like EK.  dont have too a high a hope on the amenity kit, tooth paste/brushes and razor/gel pouch were available in the toilets. Again rekha darling lovd herr on board red vino selection. Arrival at LAX was a no brainer, had to wait a bit longer than expected for bags, exit of Immigration with a US PP and global entry was a breeze. given my tepid experience on the BLR-SIN leg the prestigious NA sector ULHs were in a different league. Towards the end of the 14 hr 15 min nonstop, I did thank the cabin crew and the service manager for the warm and excellent SQ service. I also realised that in J, the crew is super busy preparing and serving a 3 course meal. Overall these ULH flights are a challenge for the flight crew. My salaams to them. Give it a try and check it out for yourself someday (SQ ULHs). Enroute we flew over the Midway atoll, well known in WW2 naval lore, with a clear view of the lagoon and runway from 37K feet.",

                    "My wife and I recently resumed our regular trips from the USA to the Philippines post pandemic. We decided to try Singapore airlines and flew aboard the famous SQ21 flight Newark to Singapore just shy of 19 hours, touted as the world's longest regularly scheduled flight! As an aviation buff I was stoked to experience this long flight, having flown 16.5 hours I figured what's a couple more hours. First of all, there is no economy class on these flights. It's a premium economy and in price comparable to what the competition is charging for economy. That being said, the seats were so much more comfortable, larger, more room, exceptional leg room and the premium economy cabin is in a 2X4X2 configuration. Traveling as a couple my wife and I enjoyed a two seat row to ourselves, which was awesome not having to disturb a stranger to get up mid flight to use the lavatory or stretch your legs. If you travel solo they offer phenomenal single seats that come with extra inflight storage. There is an additional nominal fee for these seats if I'm not mistaken but well worth the money for a long flight like this if you're traveling alone. The food was very good for airline food. You have two options, choose from the inflight menu or log in to the website preflight and choose the \"book the cook\" option which not only gives you a choice of gourmet meals but you'll get your meal first! So take advantage of this if you fly with Singapore airlines. The Singapore airlines cabin crews are second to none! The service was exceptional, they are so well trained, so friendly, attentive and professional, we can't say enough good about them! The Aircraft itself was an Airbus A350-900 in the ULR configuration. \" Ultra Long Range\". It was a beautiful airplane inside and out. I was an aviation buff was able to appreciate the design and sound and feel of it's very powerful and reliable engines. I was very very pleased with the whole experience. This was just one of 6 flights we recently flew to and from the Philippines from Newark NJ/NY 4 of which were with Singapore airlines. I've flown aboard their competition and I can tell you Singapore airlines is the best in my opinion for long haul service US to Asia. We will be flying with them again next year for sure without question. Thank you again Singapore Airlines for the great and memorable flights we really enjoyed them! ✈️",
                    "Paid for Prem Econ as these were very long flights.   Had left NZ on AirNZ Pem Econ and really enjoyed the experiences.  However, Singapore Airlines Prem econ was basically economy with a larger seat.  Sadly lacking in a number of areas that Air NZ provided - separate toilets from Econ, nicer food, better service with dedicated stewards, hot towels, plenty of snacks.  Definitely wouldn't book Prem Econ with Singapore again unless they improve their offering.",
                    "Regular BA flyer (nothing wrong with them, by the way) but my experience with Singapore Airlines has blown me away. Helped me with a premium economy multi-trip plan, which BA doesn't have on its website, and then gave us front row seats when it wasn't possible to seat us together during one leg of our flights. Took about 45 seconds for someone to pick up the phone, and they did all this proactively and called me back the next day. I wasn't expecting this level of service but was blown away.

With its ticket price I expect a better service than its competitors airlines but am surprised that it has been reduced to average. Other than the hot tower that still remains, the food is average and there is no offer of any snack between meals and very infrequent offer of drinks and no more choice’s of drinks other than water. On the return flight there was a rush to serve meal just before landing.",
                    "Singapore airlines just disappointed me this time around when flying from Delhi to Krabi via Singapore and back. I was very disappointed with the cost cutting done by them be it the drinks / food or the overall service. I overlooked other airlines and spent good above 600 US $ for 4 pax extra but it all went waste. The flight even got delayed, then as mentioned service / food / drinks were not as it used to be on this sector and then icing on the cake that my luggage was manhandled and given to me in broken condition for which I am pursuing with them.",
                    "“Personalised service? You can’t get that in many airlines nowadays, much less in Economy class.” This is a statement that I always see in the comments section for flight reviews on YouTube. Being an avid traveller and a frequent flyer in Economy class, this would be a statement that I would agree with to a large extent based on my experience on Singapore Airlines and other airlines carriers during the pre-and-post covid era. However, Singapore Airlines has proven me wrong today during my flight from Hong Kong to Singapore on SQ899 on 13/9/2023. When I was at my seat, I requested a set of playing cards from a friendly Air Steward named Mr. Cedric Chan. He was very hospitable and he was very professional in explaining to me that the flight today had no stock of playing cards. As I was already told by the air stewardess on the flight from SIN to HKG on SQ 898 on 9/9/2023 that they had no more cards, I simply brushed it off and told Mr Cedric that he did not need to worry too much about not fulfilling my request. \n\nIt was much later during the flight that really surprised me. Mr Cedric Chan gifted me a Singapore Airlines bag and placed amenities such as socks, sleeping masks, and bathroom slippers that could be used for my next flight with SIA in November. He took the time to chat with me about our travels in Hong Kong and we even talked about our National Service days when he realised that I was still serving my National Service in Singapore! Both of us discovered that both of us love collecting SIA memorabilia and are Harry Potter fans! When he realised that I would be travelling to London on 7/11/2023, he quickly recommended the Warner Bros Harry Potter studio. When I went back to my seat after our chat, he came back with one more set of amenities for my dad and he gave me 2 Business class Menus as a souvenir to make up for the lack of playing cards. I was sincerely touched by his gesture and he came to my seat again to bid me farewell before landing. \n\nOverall, thank you Singapore Airlines for the unforgettable memories with you on my flight from Hong Kong to Singapore, please keep me updated on the acknowledgment of Mr. Cedric Chan’s efforts!",
                    "After reading the reviews was expecting the worst, I needn't have worried. Excellent in flight service, especially from the crew. Pleasant food, champagne and nice wines by the glass. Seating very comfortable on this 787, though if you want to lie down your body is at an awkward angle and not conjusive to a good rest. Singapore Air did cancel one of my return flights to Perth which left me with a 12 hour stopover after flying in from Bangkok, but that's another story.",
                    "We flew from Singapore to Hyderabad. The flight was comfortable, service was great. This is not our first flight and always Singapore has been great in service, timing, professionalism.",
                    "I was mislead on my choice of seat in economy using SeatGuru because I chose a seat immediately behind one of the bulkheads in Economy (A41) which was described as a preferential seat because of the extra legroom. However this was not the most comfortable row in which to travel. On the 13-hour Singapore airlines flight I was on in August 2021 there were only about 16 travellers in economy so every traveller had three seats. This meant that all the other travellers could lift up the movable armrests and stretch out and sleep on three seats; however I could not do that because the armrests on the seats immediately behind the bulkheads are fixed and do not lift up. Those ones with the so-called extra legroom are no longer preferential.",
                    "I usually don't review airlines, but this flight was surprisingly better than expected. The  pre-flight safety briefing using places in Singapore, is a nice variation on safety briefings.  Food was good. The flight staff attentive. There seemed to be a bit more leg room than typical economy.",
                    "I flew Singapore Airlines A350 from Singapore to Bangkok in economy and had recently flown Qantas business class and Singapore Airlines economy service left Qantas business class for dead.\n\nThe service on Singapore Airlines was great it was top notch with super friendly and efficient staff who were on top of everything. Great service, good food. the aircraft was clean and modern and quiet not like the old A330 we flew on Qantas and seriously it was like chalk and cheese. Singapore Air was so much better in every aspect, from friendly great service, good food, clean modern plane it jsut won out in every aspect",
                    "This was our first international trip since Covid. We booked premium economy fights roundtrip because it was a 17 hour flight to singapore and then a little under three to Bali. After booking the flights, we began to read some of the reviews and were a bit concerned. But once we got to the airport and got on board I came to the conclusion that some people are just totally unreasonable. Our premium economy seats were mazing. We had more legroom (bulkhead) that i could have ever imagined and the seats were super comfy. The entertainment was awesome and food was better than i could have expected for airline food.\n\nFor our return trip we decided to splurge and upgrade from premium economy to business class. All I can say is wow, well worth the upgrade. The moment we walked on the plane we were greeted by name at our seats, with drinks and anything else we could have needed. The seats were amazingly comfortable and the lay flat option made us realize that was the only way to travel extremely long distances. We were able to do books the cook as a food option. I know it was our first time in business class, but i didn't think eating on an airplane could feel like being in a fancy restaurant. Overall an absolutely amazing experience and we can't wait to fly with Singapore Airlines again. We would recommend them to anyone!!",
                    "Previous experiences on Singapore Airlines were excellent. This time was disappointing as all standards have come down. \nOur anniversary celebrations were spoilt maybe because we were having more expectations. Condition of my seat in picture attached. ",
                    "We had a wonderful experience with Singapore Airlines. We travelled from Sydney to istanbul and returned back to Australia and we had a great experience with Singapore airline team. We have two young toddlers which was challenging to entertain them. The crew in SQ392 Steffanie,Paul,sadiq,yiwen,qing,Ashley and saqinah helped us to keep our toddlers busy and our travel enjoyable. We definitely recommend Singapore airlines.",
                    "First time flying Singapore Airlines.   The plane was an Airbus; good leg room in Economy seating; the free headphones were much better than the ones on other airlines.    Entertainment selection was good - listened to a BB King album, then George Michael.  Didn't watch any movies because it was a short flight, but there was a pretty good choice in different genres.s  The lunch was tasty - rice with ginger pork and chocolate ice cream for dessert.  Gate and cabin crews friendly and efficient.",
                    "My flight on February 18th shows how bad service has become since I flew with them in 2020. A flight of more than 14 hours. Two meals served of poor quality. One snack in between. I had to go back to the rear to get some water because no answer to the call and found the flight attendants eating. I hardly ever saw an attendant in between meals. Uncomfortable seats. Wi-Fi did not work for me. And this flying from their home base. The Singapore airport is amazing. It deserves a better home airline than what this has become.",
                    "We have just returned from Bali. Our return from Singapore with Singapore Airlines was more than disappointing it was unacceptable. We flew Premium Economy, the seats are more comfortable but once the person in front reclines their seat it’s is as bad as economy. You need to book row 31 for window seats or middle 33 .. if not available don’t waste your money. Seats aside what was the deal breaker to travel with Singapore again was the crew. The attitude was terrible. They clearly did not want to be working.. rude, indifferent and clearly irritated by every passenger. Food was dreadful, cold and a lack of drinks being offered. Should have asked but didn’t want to poke the bear… High price tag for low and poor service.",
                    "This was a great flight the service was perfect the food was good and plentiful the seats were good with plenty of room even in economy we landed on time didn't take to long to de plane ",
                    "The quality of the food was poor and the choice was poor too. we were seated at the back and when it came to our seat there was no choice. We had to eat what they gave. There was no dessert and the flight attendant was caring a box of ice cream cups and asking everyone if anyone want one or not. There was no water served, no coffee or tea was given unless asked. One soft drink can was served to two or three persons. wine was not even mentioned.",
                    "Staff on board were friendly, efficient and absolutely professional on all four legs of our journey. The food was very good to exceptional (inflight meals as well as oriental vego and seafood options). Very generous with drinks. Inflight entertainment was okay and better than past experience. Economy seats are getting smaller (is that possible?). We were fortunate to be surrounded by very considerate passengers who only partially inclined their seats so the longest leg (5 1/2 hours) was comfortable enough. Check in and boarding at Hanoi end was a bit chaotic. Our only complaint is the ground staff when departing Perth who didn't know the rules for carrying liquids in hand luggage and insisted we check a bag in. She was adamant that she was right and refused to check for us. We didn't hold our ground because we didn't want to hold up other passengers. We checked with Singapore later and she was wrong! ",
                    "I had a great experience on this airline from check in to boarding service meals to disembarking. We got help with luggage hot towels to clean hands and a tasty meal. My one tip would be to fly at least premium economy!",
                    "Singapore Airlines are a very good airline in the air. Their business class lounges in Singapore are terrible and  fail dismally compared to other airlines business class lounges.\n\nThe A350 is a lovely smooth quiet aircraft and the interior is clean, comfortable for economy and the aircraft is modern and very smooth.\n\nIt was an overnight flight so service was rather limited as was the food more of a snack, but the cabin and crew are pleasant friendly and attentive.\n\nI wish Singapore airline improved their lounges as they are such poor quality but in the air they are a very good airline and always an enjoyable trip. I have flown business and economy on Singapore Airlines A350 and they are both good products and clean, comfortable and this is a good airline to fly with.",
                    "I have used Singapore Air 10 times for flights to Australia over the last 15 years. In that time, a lot has changed including the food portions and amount of meals offered. Don't even think about it if you have special dietary needs as you will not get enough to eat. I took a lot of snacks and chocolate thankfully as there was a 9hr gap between meals going out to Australia and also returning to Manchester. Do they think that people with food intolerances can eat kit kats, muffins and crisps containing wheat? Come on, is this really a world class airline??When I asked for ice cream..nah that contained gluten also.. No, it is not eorld class. Now, on a positive note the airline staff were most helpful on the 13 hour leg of the flights but even so I was served a stone cold gluten free meal and had to send it back to the kitchen. That is the last time I will fly with Singapore Air sadly.",

Great F&B options as well.\n\nBoarding : A separate area reserved for premium passengers , but made no sense , nor was it being followed. Priority boarding was enforced though.\n\nSeat / Layout : Our aircraft was the A350-900. Business Class is divided into 2 cabins ( 1 large , 1 small ) separated by a galley.

The seats are very comfortable , and thankfully the footrest is straight , not angulated as seen in the A380.\n\nService : Very courteous staff , who ensured that the service throughout the flight was incredible , and personalized.\n\nFood & Beverages : 'Book the Cook' was unavailable.

We required assistance regarding our booking and following an email asking for help, we had all our questions answered and received the best service ever from an airline. Travelling economy can make long haul travel very trying, but we were lucky to be seated in the forward section (at a small extra cost). The toilets were clean throughout the 10 hour flight (arriving  45 mins early).We skipped the first meal, due to having already eaten but our nearby neighbours appeared to enjoy their meals. Service from the cabin crew was prompt throughout the flight. The second meal was tasty and despite being virtually the last to receive our meals we both got our first choices. The best thing about Singapore airlines and arriving at Changi Airport is the superior speed of the baggage arriving at the carousel. We were through immigration, thanks to the speedier online Electronic Visitor Pass, and customs, and in a taxi heading to our hotel 35kms away and checked in before our flight was due to arrive - what a great welcome to Singapore after a long haul flight!",

Then I was told that they have no more bassinet seats as it’s first come first served and I wasn’t first - despite having booked this flight three months earlier (and having been confirmed in the bassinet seat at time of booking). Singapore then lied and lied to me, first promising me the bassinet will be assigned at check in (LIE) and then telling me they will block out the seat next to me so I can lie the baby down to stretch her limbs from time to time (LIE). They have done NOTHING to help me but lied and lied. I am now faced with having a busy, wriggling 5 month old on my lap for 13 hours, alone with a stranger sat next to me which is nothing short of child cruelty and mental abuse of a mother! \n\nOh and I am a silver KrisFlyer member for all the good that has done. \n\nSingapore you are disgusting and vile to treat a single mother this way.",

                    "Singapore Airlines is a very good airline. But avoid flying Singapore first class out of Paris. It uses the Alliance /Air Canada  lounge. When we were there the lounge was so full there was no seating (a Air Canada  flight  and two United Airlines flights were departing around the same time), there was minimal food (and what there was inedible) , and no drinks- a hell hole. Appalling. It would be better to use the terminal generally.\n\nWe were taken to the plane by bus. That was not a problem. But first class passengers boarded first followed by a conga line of economy passengers filing past us. Again no problem except for the stares  and rude comments from those other passengers- one man stared  at me and then almost spat at me saying \"lucky bastard\".\n\nThe main reason for flying first is to avoid hassles and to be able to relax- this was certainly not the case with Singapore Airlines in Paris.",
                    "What happened to Singapore  Airline? My flight out from  London to Christchurch was fine - very good for an economy class flight, as was the flight from Christchurch to Singapore, where I changed planes.  Then came the 14 hour flight to London. It was 14 hours of torture and discomfort punctuated with very poor food. ( Dry and overcooked pasta and chicken breast, no sauce, and veal sausages for breakfast.  No vegetarian options, and they ran out of white wine}. The seats in the new airbus  are tiny and the legroom is very limited, jammed up against the seat in front.  I’m 174 cm tall and not overly large. It was comparable to  China Southern, which is a lot cheaper and does not pretend to be a premium airline. I’ve done this trip several times on Singapore, but I think I have to reconsider using them. I’ve  had severe back pain all week, since this flight.  And when we got to Heathrow, there was a long wait for baggage as the airline didn’t have the resources to unload the baggage, so a 40 plus minute wait for most passengers, without explanation or assistance from the airline, and I had to pay an hours wait time to the car service I booked.",

                    "My first trip after the pandemic was a little disappointing.  The aircraft was good (an A350) but the Business seats were poor compared to their competitors.  It is apparently their 'regional seat' for shorter haul journeys. It is too skinny and a tight fit for your feet if sleeping. It is 'second class'.\n\nFood was good but the staff forgot to offer me the Refreshment meal.  I did not complain because the tray table at my seat was not working properly and I did not want to be caught jammed in my seat ( as happened at Lunch).  However, they did not find out until clearing up and while apologetic, it was poor considering the prices demanded for Business these days. It also appears that you have to ask for a second drink as I was never offered one. Tea and coffee are in short supply as well. \nI 'booked the cook' for Lunch and the food was excellent but like 'special meals' it came early before the regular meal service and I had finished eating before any wine or other drinks came around. \nThe Cabin Crew are always nice but it appears that organisation is lacking and my flight was disappointing as a result.  Certainly second class for the price.",
                    "Excellent flight with Singapore airlines! We were chatting with the stewardesses and mentioned it was our 24 wedding anniversary and they came and surprised us with cake cards champagne and a little gift bag! We were so shocked!",

Inflight entertainment was too complicated and if you did find a movie you wanted to watch the supplied headphones didn't work very well so much so I couldn't make out half of what was being said. I couldn't chose my own seat the computer did it for us,  on one leg we were not sitting together.\nThe experience with Singapore Airlines was so bad that I might even consider flying Qantas again",

Don't get me wrong, it got me from SIN to HAN ok but it was a little 737 max for an international flight, was served a bento box for a meal, and to be honest I was really hoping for more. The ticket was more than say on Vietnam Air or Air Asia so I thought you really got more bells and whistles but it was just a regular flight with almost no frills. Even the excess baggage fee was quite high, you would think after paying for such a high ticket they would cut you some slack on the fees. In flight service was fine but I thought they would come around more than just giving you your \"take-away\" box. I guess all the hype that Singapore Airlines has the best service is no longer. At least I left out of T2 (versus 4) from Changi but I'll be flying someone else on those routes next time. ",

                    "Singapore Airlines is a good, quality airline however, has room for improvement. The crew onboard were attentive, friendly and always willing to help. \n\nThe food onboard was excellent - really tasty and good sized portions, however, fewer meals and snacks were provided compared to other Middle Eastern airlines flying a similar route (2x meals compared to 3x in a 13 hour period). Snacks were available on-request or if you visited the galley, however, passengers were not made aware of this and had to investigate for themselves.\n\nSimilarly, amenities such as toothbrushes and toothpaste are found in the bathrooms and again, passengers are not made aware of this unless they asked.\n\nOnboard entertainment is great, with an extensive library of TV shows and movies to choose from - none of which seemed to have content censored as some Middle Eastern airlines do. \n\nMy biggest complaint for Singapore Airlines was the onboard lights were dimmed shortly after departure and remained off for the majority of the flight (approx 10 out of 13 hours), despite the flight arriving in the late afternoon in London. We arrived in London when it was dark, having sat in a dark flight, therefore not seeing light for nearly 24 hours until we woke the next morning. On other airlines offering long-haul flights like this, they light the flight and offer meals at times to help passengers adjust to the destination timezone. Singapore Airlines appeared to make no attempt to do this and it meant that while it was light outside the plane for several hours before the aircraft lights came on, we stayed in darkness for most of the day. \n\nThe other issue we found was that several passengers were allowed to bring several bags of carry-on luggage (3+ bags per person). As such, there was no room for our 1x backpack in the overhead compartment and I was forced to fly with it under the seat in-front, significantly compromising my legroom and comfort on a 12-hour flight. ",
                    "Their Premium Economy cabin is a RIP-OFF. We always fly Premium Economy class when traveling international due to the distance. Very sad to report that we were very disappointed with the dimension of the seat. Due to the poor design where the tray is integrated into the arm rest, so the dimension they show on their site is BOGUS. The arm rest takes up at least 2 inches of the seat leaving you with  the actual seat size that is no larger than their economy class seat. DO NOT PAY the extra $800-$1000 extra for SIA PE Cabin. The footrest does not extend properly, and the seat DOES NOT recline like premium economy in other airlines. The service on the slight from SFO-SIN was great (good attentive stewardess due to higher ratio of staff to passengers, the bathroom was clean and they were generous with their food and beverage/snack services) but on the return flight it was truly a plain old economy class service. In addition to that, they were long delays while we were in transit which resulted in my missing my reunion luncheon with classmates whom I have not seen in over 40 years. The customer service of ground crew is not up the the SIA golden class services they promote. During the over 2-3 hour delay, we were in the waiting area which has no water or bathroom facilities. When I asked the crew how long the delay would be (we arrived early at 0730 for our 1100 flight, missing breakfast etc. ) I was told she has no information to share. Asked if there is sufficient time to leave the area to grab food and do a bathroom break (this was at 1230), was told she has no idea... \nAll in all not worth the extra $$$$ and given the mediocre ground service, and the delays etc. I would not use them again, when there are so many other great options out there for premium economy cabins with other airlines. Cathay Pacific is top of our list for Asian travel, Lufthansa, Air France, United and definitely Virgin Air. We heard so much about SIA and decided to pay the HUGE difference in cost this time around. NEVER AGAIN.",
                    "3 years agio this business class product used to be a quality one. Now it is absolutely awful. Aircraft is messy, old and dirty, but that's not even the headline of awful. It is the staff. From the minute you enter the lounge to the time you exit the flight, it is so unpleasant bordering on hostile. I have never experienced a worse business class airline experience in my life, and I can't even imagine how bad the economy class must be!!!",
                    "I flew with SIA in the past and had a great experience (not long haul flight). This was my first flight since the pandemic, I knew things won't be the same as they were before, but I was very disappointed with this flight. I guess this is due COVID, but there was no hot towels or a drink before taking off. To view the menu you have to connect to their WiFi. They served dinner after an hour and it was not that good, why is there no salad? I was left hungry. I asked for a Singapore Sling and never saw the FA again. About 10 hours after dinner was served some people were complaining that they haven't had anything to eat for 10 hours! I saw people getting noodle soup served at the other side during the flight, but where I was sitting no one ever came and offered anyone snacks! For breakfast I asked for prawn noodles, but to my surprise it was rice and fish, at least it was good, I didn't bother telling them about the wrong dish. Also no toothbrush and mouthwash in the loo like before. I had high hopes for this flight but it was a total let down.",

There is no room directly in front of you and there is a small footwell at the side. The result is a really cramped lie flat experience. This could have been easily solved by having the seats staggered creating legroom directly in front...as most other airlines do. Crazy stuff, great crew let down by stupid design. Would never pay the dollars to flybwith them again.",
                    "Similar experience to most of the other Air Singapore premium economy reviews on Tripadvisor. No amenity kit. Economy food. Economy toilet.

Basically same as economy with a little more leg room but much more expensive. Air nz and British Airways premium economy are far better.",
                    "I'm surely not the only one who's had to put travel on hiatus due to the ongoing pandemic but it's a good feeling knowing that it's finally more practical to travel again.  Taking a short trip to Bangkok to begin with, the feeling of finally getting back on a plane was refreshing.  Check-in and luggage submission for this mid-morning flight was fairly easy with lots of ground staff around to provide assistance.  I also got to board in an earlier group which was useful for getting settled into my window seat.  As usual, the Krisflyer system was superb with hours and hours of movies, TV shows, music and games to keep any traveller entertained,  Singapore Airlines has changed the way their meals are presented - the new boxes (as opposed to trays) is a nice change and is likely to also help keep the heat in longer.  I've rarely enjoyed the airline's economy class breakfasts but the century egg congree I had was wonderful - hot, tasty, and more satisfying than the noodles or omelette that's usually offered.  We also had the benefit of a clear day that made views out the window interesting.  Here's to more flying in the coming months ahead!",

Portions of the lounge were dirty. Horrible F&B options. Expected much more considering the recent privatization of AI.\n\nBoarding : Very streamlined. Dedicated queue / gate / aerobridge for Suites & Business Class passengers. Attentive ground staff & crew made it even better.\n\nSeat / Layout : \nAll the Business Class seats ( along with the 6 Suites ) were on the Upper Deck in this newer A380 variant , arranged in 1-2-1 pattern. Plush & comfortable , as long as you don't sleep. The moment you convert it into a lie-flat bed , you'll encounter the infamous angulated coffin-style hole for your legs / feet , which is uncomfortable for even someone as short as me.\nThe seat control panel on my particular seat was not smooth / a bit erratic . Even the FA Call Button did not work , thus had to rely on the remote control option. This wasn't the case for the other seats occupied by my family members , where things worked perfectly fine.\n\nService : Extremely professional & quick.\n\nFood : Used 'Book The Cook' service. Herb Crusted Pork Chops were undercooked. The Chilli Basil Prawn was quite good though.",
                    "We were flying Sydney to Frankfurt and as this airline was rated the best for many years we decided to fly with them.We booked business class.It is extremely uncomfortable.I am 6foot 4inches.The seat reclines but your feet are crushed against the seat in front of you.It converts to a lay flat bed.However you legs go into a tunnel.My size feet don’t allow you to lay on your side because the tunnel isn’t wide enough.I spent a very uncomfortable time trying to sleep.Never again with this airline.",
                    "In 30 years, this flight was my worst experience. I don't understand why the baby bassinet was placed in front of my seat instead their parents. The service was terrible because they forgot to serve part of the food and made a mistake if you order a especific dish (too dangerous if I alergic) \nIt was imposible to rest because the cabine crew disturbed you every time to support baby parents. Ok, it is important to help the babies but it's not necessary that they forget the rest of passengers.",
                    "I recently transited through  Changi with Singapore airlines  (business class) .l have flown with Singapore airlines well over 40 times but something is now drastically wrong..\nChangi terminal was a nightmare, everything was shut ,despite walking 2km through terminal 1 and 2 l couldn't find a coffee shop open at 9am.\nThen l was forced to stand in line for over 30 minutes in sweltering temperatures (not adequately air conditioned) only to be herded though like animals. Obviously without adequate staff or screening facilities our flight was going to be delayed, well over half an hour. \nThe flight was not much better. Why send staff around taking drink and food orders only for passengers to wait 30 /40 minutes to receive them.The food was terrible, nothing fresh,tasteless  ,in fact l was ill for a couple of days after the flight. \nSo in summary my experience was so bad l won't be using Singapore airlines again.",

                    "Purchased Return flight from Sydney to Paris with “Singapore airlines”. \nThe way over was great, with a 3 hour stopover in Singapore both legs were aboard the kind of plane I had in mind; Standard economy class seats with things like slightly adjustable head rests, a pillow, light blanket, entertainment (a tv with some movies etc) built,  food service of an at least edible quality and attentive staff that bring around water etc from time to time. It’s an expectation that’s been developed over 30+ years of international travel.\nWithout exception, every provider seems to have nailed this basic formula.\nIt’s this expectation that was shocked, when on our return trip, the flight Paris to Singapore was as expected, started well, and I was luck enough to be moved to an exit row seat 😊\nIt was when boarding the second leg that my trip turned so bad that it’s warranted this review.\nThe ticket said Singapore, but after following instructions I boarded my first scoot. \nFirst thing I noticed was the carpet. It was so incredibly warm that it has viably not been changed in many years and Honestly concerning to see the last time the plane was updated.\nThen the seats, there were no height adjustable head rests: being 6’5” I could not rest my head backwards with anything to support it. (Needs to be noted that I’m not expecting much just something that moves up and down a few inches), furthermore there’s no tv built into the seat in front (even in what they dubbed premium economy). \nNo entertainment at all was provided throughout the flight…\nThen the food and beverages. The fact that we had booked with Singapore airlines we were entitled to a fairly inedible “meal” (a bottle of water, a bread roll and a hot tray of 20% vDahl and 80% white rice). Not a question of “what would you like to drink”, just here, no tray, no little butter, no desert of any kind: often my favourite time on a flight is that 15 minutes of trying to eat like a T-Rex… this was the first time on a long haul flight that I can ever recall not entire onboard meal (and often any leftovers of my travelling companions).\nAll in my scoot experience exposed by Singapore airlines was shockingly uncomfortable!\nBe warned.\nHappy travels!",
                    "On my flight I got sick with severe chills headache and fever , I asked cabin crew for some medication and they stalled and didn’t give me any . I was so sick and die to Covid I kept very quiet as I didn’t want to cause chaos amongst other passengers - the first thing the cabin crew did was put in their masks and stayed away from me .. I asked the crew over and over again for medication and they DIDNT give me any - the flight was full and I suffered 17 hours with no help . Then I asked for a hot pack and they brought me a wet towel heated in the microwave which made it worse As the water started dripping all over me :( and then to make it worse they have my special\nOrdered meal to another passenger . And the Ignorant flight attendant brings me a pasta meal with shrimp . I tell her I am allergic to shrimp - she says remove the shrimp and eat the pasta only — it was a nightmare as \n I was shaking and so upset but had to keep quiet as I knew there would be chaos if I told everyone I was sick - when I sent in a complain to Singapore air - they basically told me I was lying - as the cabin crew gave me medication and they never offered me a shrimp meal - it’s sad that they didn’t at least apologize but swept my complain under the carpet ! This is so wrong :( and I wanted at least an apology .. this is the airline that calls then self the best ! They are not they are liars … and didn’t care that I suffered on the 17 hour flight -",
                    "What a disappointment Singapore Airlines were.  My husband had booked the tickets (first time in almost 40 years) as a surprise for me to celebrate my 60th Birthday.  He had no idea he should have gone on line and tried to book seats (yet another airline devising money making schemes when they charge a fortune for the tickets anyway) and when we checked in they had seated us separately and quite far apart.  They said they could do nothing about it, although there were available Business Class seats so instead of flying PE as booked, we opted to swop with our sons and sit together in economy.  The food was nothing short of dreadful for a 13 hour flight, hot dishes weren’t hot and extremely bland.  An ice cream break would have been a pleasant surprise and it’s not advertised that you can help yourself to dreadful sweet snacks from the galley when you want.  Staff were nice but in my view the airline has gone right downhill from when we used to fly them regularly 20 years ago.  On the positive side, and why I gave it 2 points were that all our flights were on time.",
                    "Services by the crew were not as good as I expected - despite promoting themselves as having the 'best services'. the food was not terrible but not great. the seats were not comfortable - I would say seats for Ryanair was better. \n\nI was also sitting next to the break room (?) for crew members so they were opening a bright lit room every few minutes throughout the 13 hrovernight flight, and I was unable to sleep. \n\nadditionally, while the millage for my return flight was added, the millage to Singapore was not added so I contacted them only to get an answer 4 weeks later that the flight is 'not millage applicable'. Terrible wording of the whole email, no respect at all. I will never fly with them again.",
                    "I have flown many business class flights on 5-star airlines such as Cathay Pacific, Qatar Airways, and Korean Air. However, on long-haul flights, Singapore Airlines' business class B777-300ER has great service, seats, and food onboard. The flight crew is very friendly. They care about me and respond quickly if I request something. The food is really tasty, especially the Western style. I ate lobster thermidor, and it is one of the best foods I have ever eaten on an aeroplane. Besides that, their hard product is the top reason why I chose Singapore Airlines. I chose 11K for my seat on this flight. The bulkhead seat provides a spacious bed, and it is wide enough that my companion and I can sit together.",
                    "The Airbus was an older model with no touch screen, no automatic seat adjustment and worst of all was the diagonal sleeping arrangement.

                    "In recent times, it's apparent that flight crews are overwhelmed with staff shortages and other workplace issues. It was a pleasant surprise to experience an attentive and positive crew on Singapore Airlines. It was refreshing to feel like a welcomed traveler on Singapore.",

Not the quality we used to expect from this airline.",

Dangerously ignorant staff-“why don’t you just have these nuts and crackers anyway?”\n\nRude staff-most requests  were be met with a loud explanation of how I must let them finish what they’re doing first, so that every other passenger who heard would think I was bossing them about.",

I get that I am travelling economy and not alot of luxury provided, however, I was extremely uncomfortable, feeling cramped against the window seat, and an uncomfortable seat as well, plus the food for not enjoyable at all - most I did not eat.   The hot towels are still provided at the beginning of the flight, but if you want any extras you have to ask - it is no longer an automatic handout to passengers anymore.  \nI paid $$ due to having to change flight details so the cost of this flight did not really match what I got out of it.",

However, the health procedures take sometime (there is heath quarantine)  form to complete online.  I ask question incorrectly which results in some delay (to my frustration).   The normal passport control and security -pretty easy.  The Shenzhen International Terminals has no shops open and no restaurants.   There is only vending machines for drinks only (poor!) and even all the drinks are not there.    Board on time.  There is about 30 minute delays as passengers are still passing through health controls.   Business Class seat (lie flat is comfortable) but the enclosing dividers for cubicle makes in seat tramped.  This is shame, and only fault of this plane.  Large passengers would find this uncomfortable and the arm would be pressed in - its obviously management did not test with large passengers.  No beverage service prior to departures, but cabin crew were make coffee / tea for passengers (on case by case basis). I was never asked, but don’t like or coffee.   However, my preordered drinks (whisky & Coke) came pretty quickly.   About 20 minutes (after departure).    I chose the beef option (see below) .   Due to covid all the features will served on one tray.  The chocolate tart (with biscuit crush) was great.   Watched two goods movies.

                    "Great airline. We flew Brisbane to Amsterdam and then from Munich to Brisbane with a stopover in Singapore. Food on all flights was generous in serving size and delicious (for airplane food). The planes themselves were a bit of a mix. Some more modern than others but they did the job and all had relatively comfortable seats in economy. Flights left on time from each destination. Entertainment options were varied and free wifi much appreciated with free Krisflyer membership. Overall very happy.",
                    "My family and I flew from Jakarta,Indonesia to Mumbai,India. The plane was predominately full of Indians as we were on a flight to Mumbai. The Singaporean staff were curt to the Indians on the plane, and seemed to think they were superior to the passengers. It was clear racism. As and Indian American I have faced many racist situations ,yet this was one of the worst. As I was heading back from the bathroom, the stewardess was in the middle of the aisle, I politely asked if she could move as I needed to get to my seat since the seatbelt sign was on, she curtly replied, “Wait your turn” as she turned back around. It almost seemed as if I was the staff and she was the paying passenger. The very same lady decided to act in a rude manner towards me the entire flight, from meal service, and even where I got of the flight. The flight itself was 5 hours long, and was hard to endure with an arrogant staff. While the facilities on the plane were alright, I would not recommend Singaporean Airlines to anyone who wants a pleasant racism free journey to their destination.",

                    "I knew SG airlines are considered the best out of all but it was rather mediocre or sub par actually.\nFood was rather bad and they never heat up bread so it was always cold. The stewardesses seemed annoyed when I asked for a beer or any other additional small service.\nOne girl didn't even understand the word \"butter\" and when I made a gesture of spreading on bread and she thought I was after jam and told me \"bread already sweet enough lah\"and walked off\nI wasn't angry or anything and took it as it is what it is but I was a little surprised. \nWell COVID changed everything and this probably is new normal. \nAt least all my 4 flights arrived on time and I safely returned.",

All in all very deceiving.",
                    "What a miserable flight. There are ways to make 16 hours of cramped economy class seating bearable. It's too bad Singapore Airlines hasn't figured out any of them. First of all, the sunset in Los Angeles in August is just before 8pm. The flight leaves close to midnight. The entire flight is in darkness except for the last half hour or so.\n\nThe plane was kept in near DARKNESS for the entire time until we landed. Singapore is on the equator. Do you guys live in 19 hours of darkness? Turn on the lights! At least fake that it's morning somewhere. I was seriously thinking this was a Twilight Zone episode.\n\nThe food was pathetic. Entree + side. Later, ice cream was handed out which tasted better than the food. Having flown SIA through the 1990's and 00's it was kind of sad to see how far the airline had fallen. Then again, maybe Covid is to blame for my bad experience. But covid didn't keep the sun from rising.\n\nOur contiuing flight to Male was much better. Mainly because it was shorter.",
                    "We recently flew Singapore Airlines to Sydney and Thailand and we received fantastic service.

I would definitely use again.",
                    "The experience was very good on both Outbound to Inbound flights. As we travelled on PE we received priority boarding which was good especially as we were travelling with my 80 year old dad.  PE is very good especially the Leg room, which is the main reason I wanted it and being over double some economy fares it satisfied our needs. Extra recline also made a difference and  was bearable even when the person in from was reclining. The PE cabin only has 4 rows 2-4-2 and is separated from the main economy cabin which made it feel more spacious.\n\nFlight was smooth and comfortable\nStaff were great. Helpful and very accommodating when needed.\nFood was good although had the option to Book the Cook prior to flight.\n\nI know some airlines are starting to increase leg room to 40 inches SIN (38) which would be great when you consider the extra money that is paid.\n\nOn our return from Croatia at Frankfurt there were flight delays which meant we would miss our connection from SIN MEL But both Lufthansa an Singapore Airlines made this a much less stressful experience, in fact a great little adventure. At FRA we received meal vouchers and were updated regularly by helpful staff and when we arrived in SIN everything was organised as soon as we got of the plane.\n\nMeal vouchers, hotel vouchers, Taxi to hotel and back, assistance with getting our entry visa on arrival. \n\nChoose a good airline and the combo of Lufthansa and especially flying major legs with SIN airlines made it an easy, comfortable experience. I would highly recommend.\n\n",

What else can I say?   ",
                    "I have been flying Singapore Airlines for 42 years. There is no question that it is not the airline it once was. However, on this route it is still far far better than any other option. Service is far better as is the food, etc than United. My last business flight with United was shocking. Service was non existant and food on the long flight was just sad. As one passenger said who had slept through a meal - “Do you just have kids food for snacks?”.  Cathay Pacific was a form of torture with tight seats and flight boarding that is total mayhem. SIA is trying and still the best. I would warn you that having traveled with them after two surgeries in the past the wheel chair service in Changi  is abysmal and the United Polaris clubs are nicer.  SIA is also particularly hard to get a status match - even for United 1K or Million Milers. They also have a website that rejects a lot of itineraries meaning you have to book separately. Where they REALLY  are TERRIBL is communication as it is nearly impossible to get a human. The chat feature proved useless for me recently, even after he forwarded an itinerary that an agent said was impossible. Very frustrating! At least United has good Milage Plus service and no PIN is needed to contact them. However, I JUST booked a flight with SIA and know I will have several more in the next year. They are the best over the Pacific if you don’t mind the nightmare of their website and customer service. ",
                    "The partner lounge at Haneda was terrible, more like a hawker center in Singapore. The atmosphere of exclusivity was totally nonexistence.\nThe crew services in business class was mediocre, missing out and forgetting drink orders. Paid no attention to children travelling; not offering them drinks during the lull period when they are awake. No children amenities offered to the kids.\nThe food out of Haneda was horrendous, no way associated to premium class food.\nThe seats were comfortable enough though, little saving grace.",

Satisfying more than 500 flyers is not easy, but they managed it with charm and efficiency.  \n\nMeals, drinks, and snacks were served in a timely manner with particular attention paid to our 5 year old granddaughter.  The food, itself, was very good.  Spicy fish served with rice and vegetables or chicken cacciatore served with gnochi pasta was not expected and both were very good representations of a fine dining meal.  \n\nSeating (even in Economy) was comfortable with more than ample space for the 8 hour flight.  The individual entertainment system for each seat featured a large screen tv with hundreds of options to occupy the flight.  Interactive features allowed passengers to track the flight in progress.  \n\nAnd, with all this raving, it is important to note that this was the cheapest flight for us to take from New York to Germany.

Because the footrest was to one side of the seat, I lay at an angle with my shoulder against the arm rest. You could not press a button to go flat. You had to get up, rearrange your things, and fold the seat-back down. Insanely, there was a wing at the top of the chair covering the lower half of one of my windows. A woman with only one window, covered by the chair wing, asked to be moved to a proper window seat but nobody would trade. Another woman asked to be moved because the divide between the center seats was so high it was difficult to  help her 7 year old. The seats were far from the windows. I unbuckled and strained to see the view.",

No choice of juice.\nThe films available where limited & not up to date.\nDinner eventually arrived again inedible no before dinner drinks , the trolley had a choice red wine or white wine ( Chardonnay) but you only got half a plastic cup of wine no repeats!!\nI believe this cost cutting is to their detriment. Out of choice would never travel with them again.",

If you’re vegetarian/vegan AND GF it’s a very long 24 hrs without a meal. When paying over $7000 return you’d expect the airlines to do better for a premium seat. Surely they could have a few options of dairy free milk onboard and in their lounges too.\n\nTOP TIP go to a coffee shop once you’ve gone through customs and buy a cup of soy milk to take onboard and give to the staff to put in the fridge. \n\nAnyway regardless Singapore Airlines Staff are friendly and accommodating during the flight, the lie flat beds are comfortable & there was a good selection of movies to watch. \n\nSingapore airlines needs to lift its game for gluten free and dairy free options onboard and in the lounges.

This was a very special trip for my family and I but this time the airline was terrible and I am not normally someine who complains. This airline is supposed to be ranked in the top 10 in the world and in some lists they are ranked number 1  I do not know how this could possibly be it was terrible there is no leg room we have had more leg room on Ryanair only this flight was 13 hours the food was horrible and tasted of the containers they came in. They offered no eye mask earplugs and more important deep vien thrombosis socks which we have always got on long haul flights prior to lockdown. On the outward journey the check in was good and the crew were very nice. The return trip was appalling again the food was terrible. On the manage my booking page it showed the meals and supposedly we had the option to opt for a vegetarian option but it was not available to us and said we could change it on board however the dinner course was fish or chicken I am allergic to fish so chose chicken they were only about 20 rows into the economy section but we were told there was no more chicken I told them of my allergy they said they would get me something else. This was a night flight we were 4 row from the front of our section by the time they got to the front they started to collect the trays even when people were still eating as was my wife so they tried to take the bits that had been used I tried to get the girls attention to ask about my alternative meal but she went straight by at which time I gave it up ate my wifes roll and tried to sleep the crew clearly wanted to finish the meals turn the lights off and retire to the back of the plane as to do what ever they do there the next we saw of them until breakfast the choices there was scrambled eggs or chicken porridge I do not eat eggs and do not know what the other thing is so declined I was asked if I wanted the vegitarian option I said yes the tray the llady pulled out was the same tray with the main course removed at this point I had enough complained at what they had done she asked me would I like a chicken wrap I said yes please then a male member of the crew came to me with 2 different sandwiches one supposed to be beef and I have no idea what was in the other I said I had been promised a chicken wrap (there suggestion) to be told they had no chicken wraps I then told them sarcastically I would leave it as I had eaten 2 rolls during the flight so was full fully frustrated I put on my mask to sleep whilst this happened a member of the crew approached my wife to offer me a packet of crisps\nI am so frustrated that I intend to write direct to the CEO of Singapore airlines but in truth I expect no reply as I was a economy ticketed customer and I think they only pander to Business and 1st Class passengers so please be aware before paying this airlines over inflated prices would be my opinion",
                    "My experience flying from JFK to SIN last month was nothing short of remarkable. The plane was immaculate, food was delicious, the staff were amazing, and the 18+ hour journey just seemed to fly by (no pun intended). If you are ever so lucky, you may cross paths with Janice Ong Beng Guat, an airline stewardess on one of my flights. She displayed such a high level of excellence in customer service. She gave me a ton of tips of where to eat, what foods to try, and things worth seeing in Singapore. Her kind nature and attentiveness were present throughout the entire flight. Such a sweet lady!\n\nThank you Singapore Airlines and Janice for making the start of my trip all the more special and memorable! ",
                    "My first time flying with Singapore Airlines and it was by far the worst experience I've had with any airline. \n\nWhen I first tried to book the ticket, I got all the way to payment, only to get an error message saying they couldn't process the request and to please start over with the booking. When I started over, the price suddenly increased by over $500. Seemed like a classic bait and switch. That should have been my first clue to look elsewhere, but unfortunately I decided to go ahead with the booking at the new increased price.\n\nFor a 16 hour flight from San Francisco to Singapore, there was no toiletry kit provided. I've flown many premium economy and business class flights and toiletry kits have always been provided (plus slippers), but apparently Singapore Airlines offers nothing of this kind. I've become so used to having the toiletry kits provided that I no longer pack a toothbrush and toothpaste in my carry-on. So, for this flight I was out of luck with no way to brush my teeth. \n\nThe flight left around 10 pm pacific time, and dinner was served about an hour later. Dinner service was alright, though unusually slow compared to what I've experienced with other airlines. And the food was pretty good. But then nothing else except water was offered until almost 11 am pacific time the next day. So almost 12 hours with only water offered and no food at all. Despite the late dinner, I was starving by the time they finally got around to serving breakfast. I really cannot understand how they expect passengers to go 12 hours without at least a small snack being offered, especially when they are serving breakfast closer to lunch time relative to the departure time zone. \n\nWhen I originally booked the ticket, there was prominent language saying that you could change the booking without any additional fee. I did need to change the booking, but conveniently they claimed they didn't have tickets in my class on the date I wanted to change to. I can understand how tickets might not be available on a particular day, but they couldn't even offer a ticket within 5 days of my desired date. I suspect they had availability, but were just up-selling me. The best they could do was to \"upgrade\" my premium economy ticket to a \"flexi\" premium economy ticket for $900 more. It would still just be a premium economy seat, so the \"flexi\" option didn't really provide much added benefit. So, in effect, they wanted to charge me an additional $900 just to change the booking. \n\nAlthough I wasn't happy about it, I decided to go ahead with the upgrade and change the flight date. The agent explained that they would have to confirm the booking and call me back to arrange the additional payment. It took the agent a while to call back, so I went to SA's website to check the booking myself. The booking had been changed, but I was downgraded to regular economy, and on top of that had more than a 20 hour layover in Singapore added into the itinerary (original booking only had a few hours layover). So, on top of the $900 additional charge, I was now apparently downgraded to regular economy, plus now needed to get a hotel in Singapore for the layover. Oh, and when they finally did call me back about the booking, they hung up on me immediately and I never heard from them again.\n\nI'm sure I could have straightened out the mess with the new booking, but at this point I'd had enough. I just booked another premium economy ticket with another airline and canceled the flight with SA. \n\nThe final insult from Singapore Airlines is that they're only refunding about $300 of a $2500 round trip ticket. So I'm canceling half the flight, but getting much less than a fifth of my money back. But even with the pathetic refund amount, I think I actually saved a little bit by booking with another airline. SA is very expensive, but you apparently don't get upgraded service for the extra money. An absolutely terrible experience, I will avoid this airline at all costs in the future.",
                    "Check in and lounge\n\nWe were flying from LHR to SIN, in business, check in was such a breeze, queueless, no waiting time. The lounge was outstanding, extremely comfy seats and great service in the lounge as well as power outlets and charging spots.\n\nBoarding and ontime service\n\nBoarding was also pretty much queueless, the cabin crew greeted us warmly and showed us to our seats and when the safety video commenced, we were just leaving the gate, but the only thing that disappointed me was that our flight took off 40 mins late than scheduled but landed before the estimated time of arrival.\nProbably because air traffic control was pretty busy at that time.\n\nThe flight\n\nCrew were extremely kind, serving us food and drink every now and then we were hangry and wanting to eat or thirsty for drinks. They also have an unbelievably large in-flight entertainment selection, they were endless! Seat was also amazing, super comfy and very easy to sleep on if you are having and overnight flight out of SIN or LHR. Toilets are also very clean and regularly get disinfected, in which I believed greatly in, as I had also flown this airline back in October.\n\nArrival\n\nUpon arrival, we were all well rested and didn't want to leave the plane, the cabin crew said goodbye to us kindly and generously, and got our bags, straight as we came through passport control.\n\nOverall, an unforgettable experience with an airline like this, would highly recommend if anyone is looking for a way to get to Singapore or anywhere else.",
                    "I travelled from Kolkata to Singapore and then from Singapore to Sydney in Sep 2022. Returned in October through the same route reciprocal. In both sectors travelled via Singapore Airlines. Must say that the Singapore -Sydney leg and return was far better than the Kolkata-Singapore. The food and quality of food on board was fine. However during my return leg from Sydney to Singapore i was missed by the cabin crew when serving lunch, till after an hour wait i had to remind them.",
                    "Due to a bereavement I had to change my flight a couple of times. When I called their reservations office the staff were so understanding, kind & extremely helpful. Plus the flights were great. Good food, excellent crew. Thank you so much for making a very stressful time so much easier.",
                    "Today's flight was really efficient, and well handled by the Chief Purser Kim-Sung.  \n\nPlane was an A350-900, 9V-SHB and I was in seat 17K.  \n\nInterior was clean, tidy and didn't look tired.  I found the cabin temperature way too high, but am glad that it wasn't an overnight flight. \n \nInflight wifi was being promoted heavily - it was active but could not be connected to.  The pair-your-device didn't work at all. \n\nWhilst it is classed as a lie-flat bed, for someone who is 188cm tall and has size 11 feet, the bed is not a comfortable one as one's knees and feet can be cramped.\n\nNo amenity kit offered today, although there are toothbrushes and other items in the well-stocked and clean bathrooms.",
                    "It has been 15 years ago since I have traveled with Singapore Airlines, I know there as been a lot of cost cutting since Covid 19 but Singapore Airlines product has certainly dropped in quality. The food was not great the leg room in the seat is not great compared to other airlines. Their inflight entertainment system is not great as well.",
                    "Returning from Norway we flew Singapore Airlines on two long haul flights, Heathrow to Singapore and then Singapore to Melbourne on their Boeing 777-300ER. Although we were in Premium Economy, there was nothing premium about the service. For starters there were no complimentary amenity bags despite these being long haul flights. When requested, it took the crew member a long time to return to us with an old looking amenities bag which had obviously seen better days. All it had was a cheap pair of orange socks and a toothbrush/toothpaste. The food was nothing to shout about and the service was inattentive. The seats were uncomfortable and trying to find a comfortable position to sleep even with having taken a sleeping tablet proved difficult. What was truly disappointing was the fact that the toilets had to be shared with Economy. It meant a walk to the back of the plane to join the always long queue! Definitely not a premium service and not worth the money spent. Standards have fallen due to complacency! Won’t fly this airline or recommend to anyone else. Another airline now wears the crown; we’ll definitely consider the other airline.",
                    "we,have travelled with sq  many times , and always have excellent service until this last one on 14 February.   My husband had booked the cook , and ordered steak, which had blooded pouring out of it when he got it. He complained to the FA, and it was taken away  for about  10 minuites  and then returned to him in much the same condition.The only other thing they could offer him was 3  tiny  pieces of chicken in horrendously hot sauce, that he couldnt eat. He ended up with  a couple of crackers  and a slice of cheese, this was his business class meal.  I had some chicken satee , which tasted  fine , until 10 minutes later I was very sick, spent some time in the  toilet.  Had to ring several times before our male FA answered  the call button. These  flights cost $10000.00, so not happy jan.",
                    "Our first flight was   SQ 214   Perth to Singapore\nWe were disappointed with the Singapore Lounge at Perth Airport, it is extremely small, and quite dark.\nThe flight was nice and comfortable, the meal, the Chicken in Macadamia Nut Crust, we were very disappointed with, it was extremely  dry.\n\nOur second flight was   SQ 026   Singapore to Frankfurt  \nThis flight was one of the worst I have been on.\nMy  Book the Cook order Roasted Lamb Rack - my Lamb Rack was one chop, a thick one, but one chop?\nAfter eating my meal, I had a sleep. Upon waking I felt quite ill. I think it must have  been the food. Unfortunately I vomitted, all over myself. My husband called for help from the fight attendants. Two females appeared and the first question they asked me was what had I been drinking? All I had to drink on this flight was water -  if they paid attention to their customers - they should know this. I have never been so insulted in my life. I'm still so angry about this. The flight attendant came and suggested I wouldn't like to have breakfast - don't worry I wasn't going to anyway. There was no offer of any water or anything else.\n\nOur third flight was    SQ 2062   Frankfurt to Madrid\nThis flight was with Lufthansa Airways. The flight was a short flight , unfortunately our luggage was held up for two days. This could not be helped by the flight crew. They could do with some help with communication. Instead the passengers were left waiting, trying to find out where our luggage was.  \n \nOur fourth flight was   SQ377   Barcelona to Milan\nThis short flight was crewed by some of the best flight attendants we have ever come accross. We did not have any breakfast. We had eaten a big breakast in the Miro VIP Lounge. This was an excellent lounge, the food was wonderful. The staff on the plane were very attentive, and very engaging. Unfortunately the staff were changed when we got to Milan.\n\nOur fifth flight was  SQ377    Milan  to Singapore\nThis flight was better than Sinapore to Frankfurt. There are some inconsistences that I would like to point out. The service my husband and I received was quite stark. He was offered bread or croissant with his breakfast, I was not. I was offered wine on boarding, he was not.    \n\nOur sixth flight was  SQ223   Singapore to Perth\nThis flight suffered from the same as the flight from Milan to Singapore inconsistant service. I was also attended by the rudest gentleman I have ever encountered, he was extremely short with his attitude and would grab things out of my hand, I think this is unacceptable.  \n\nI was so looking forward to this trip, unfortunately I was very disappointed.\nI previously had two trips we had to cancel in the last five years, and I would like to thank Sinapore Airlines for the way they handled  the complete refund.\nI think I was thinking the staff and service would be as exemplary as the staff handling the refunds.\nI look forward to your reply.\nRegards\nFrances Jojart",
                    "Very disappointed  it was one of the worst experiences I’d encountered . Was travelling in economy class . 90% staff friendly and approachable the remainder not do . Awful food served unappetising . Not enough water provided  overnight  cabin way too dark . Walking to the toilet was a trip hazard trailing blankets littering the floor . Had to keep ringing for water as too dark to walk to galley . A bottle of water would have been better . On the outgoing flight on 27th Jan no breakfast served not even a hot drink offered . Will avoid in future",
                    "Honestly the worst airline I’ve ever flown with. The plane was dirty and there was rubbish under the seat in front of me when we boarded. The hygiene is so bad I was bitten by flees on all my legs. When I complained and asked for proof the plane was cleaned properly before I boarded they refused to give to me and I’ve had nothing but awful conversation and lies from the representatives. If you’re going to lie about how often your plane is cleaned at least be able to back it up. Honestly etihad was so much better and there staff were just so kind. Singapore airlines is shocking",
                    "Still one of the best airlines to fly with in the world, although they seem to have skimped on the economy class meals since the last time I flew 2 and a half years ago. the B787-10 aircraft was in immaculate condition and the seats and in-flight entertainment are easy to use. Convenience of USD port and electrical socket for charging laptop or gadget in every seat.\n\nThe service from check-in to boarding to in-flight also in a class of its own.\nThe service from the cabin crew, which Singapore Airlines is known for all over the world is exceptional and never a let down.\n\nI give a 4 bubble Very Good rating instead of the 5 bubble Exceptional rating is because of there seems to be some cut back on the meals served in Economy. It used to come with an appetizer (example : fruit/veg with shrimp/salmon), main meal, desert, hot bun, butter and a set of cutlery with sachets of salt, pepper, sugar and creamer. However this time there's no appetizer, salt, pepper, etc.\n\nOtherwise a pretty comfortable flight, with enough time for a short nap in between.",
                    "I have flown with SIN air 30 years ago and their flights were great services and good food. After that I didn't have a chance to fly with SIN for several reasons and this year I decided to fly with SIN again and boy it was so disappointed with their services and meals that they provided during the trip from SGN-SIN and SIN-LAX.\nThe flight attendances were so cold and not friendly, their choices for drink were limited only coke, Sprite for soda, water, Orange and apple juices, Lipton tea and coffee. I asked for soda with ice and they said they don't have it until later but later never came. Their drinks weren't cold.\nThe meals were so basic with bread, butter, 1 simple dessert and plain main course while other airlines offered extra like salad, fruits and more choices for main course.\nThe only thing it was good that they were pretty much on time on both legs\nThe seats for my first leg were Premium Economy so I have no complain, the seats for  2nd leg I got an empty seat in between so I didn't feel the pain of small seat for 15+ hour flight time\nEntertainment selections were not the latest and not whole lot of choices\nIf I have a choice to chose airline in the future compare for pricing, time and services, I wouldn't go with SIN airline if the price is not much cheaper than other airlines",
                    "The Singapore Airlines aircraft used for this BKK-SIN segment is fitted with 40 regional Business Class seats and 263 Economy Class seats. Business Class onboard this version of Singapore Airlines A350-900 is arranged in a large forward section and a smaller aft section. In addition, the Singapore Airlines regional Business Class cabin is decked in an earthy brown scheme. With the appropriate use of cabin lighting during boarding, the Business Class cabin exudes a comfortable and cosy feel. Seats in Singapore Airlines regional Business classes are arranged in a 1-2-1 configuration, giving all Business Class passengers direct aisle access.\n\nThe Singapore Airlines regional Business Class seats have a seat pitch of 60″ and 28″ wide and offer excellent legroom. The choice of leather in the seats in Singapore Airlines’ regional Business Class feels very premium and comfortable. A thick blanket and an oversized pillow are placed on the seat. Resting on the thick and fluffy pillow made me fall asleep despite the short 2-hour flight time. As this is a short flight, no mattress toppers are made available. Other than the three main modes – takeoff/landing, lounging, and flatbed mode, the seats are so customisable that passengers in the Singapore Airlines Business Class seats would find an angle that one would find comfortable. I find the fully flat 180 deg bed mode uncomfortable but found comfort in the seat at a slight elevation in its bed mode. The cocoon-designed seats ensure passengers get maximum privacy, even for those sitting next to the aisle.\n\nThe touchscreen seat controls are fitted in a very convenient part of the seat, allowing passengers to adjust to the seats and find the optimal angle that maximises their comfort. In addition, some standard options in the controls provide passengers with the convenience of getting to these modes at the touch of a button. There is a small cabinet at the side of the seat where the noise-cancelling headphones are placed for passengers to store smaller items. Here, passengers can also charge their mobile devices via the two USB outlets or the power outlet. The cocktail table next to the seat serves the dual purpose of placing a drink cup and a space for passengers to stow their items.\n\nA solid wooden table is stowed underneath the PTV., which is large enough to provide a decent space for passengers to work on their laptops. I like the flexibility of folding the table into half its size when passengers do not require the entire table, making getting in and out of the seat easier. The ottoman under the PTV in the regional Business Class seat provided extra comfort for passengers to rest their legs on. There is a space under the ottoman for shoes or bags. Speaking of storage for baggage, each passenger in Business Class gets an entire overhead bin space to themselves. A coat hook is strategically placed next to the PTV for passengers to hang their coats. I used this hook to hang the mango sticky rice I bought at the airport before boarding. I find the placement of the seat pocket under the coat hook to be a tad difficult to reach. Otherwise, this would be an additional space for passengers to stow smaller items. Due to the pandemic, the seat pocket contents were reduced to the safety card and an airsick bag.\n\nThe Singapore Airlines regional Business Class seats are fitted with a large 18″ touchscreen personal TV. The touchscreen functions on the PTV are very responsive and are an alternate way for passengers to choose from the wide range of entertainment options from Singapore Airlines’ KrisWorld. KrisWorld is loaded with movies, TV shows, music and games to keep passengers entertained even on a long flight. Business Class passengers are provided with noise-cancelling headphones, which effectively block out all sounds. The padded ear cups provided additional comfort when wearing. The IFE controller is stowed under the seat controls. The touchscreen mobile phone-like IFE controller is very easy to use, and the touchscreen function is equally responsive. One can display the flight map on the IFE controller while watching a movie on the PTV at the same time. In addition, Singapore Airlines KrisFlyer members can link their Singapore Airlines app to the IFE onboard. However, the onboard wifi must be switched on by the pilot (which is done so only after the aircraft reaches cruising altitude).\n\nDue to the pandemic, pre-departure drinks and snacks are not offered as part of the service in Business Class. After the seat belt signs were turned off in-flight, we were only served plain water. Singapore Airlines does not offer their signature “book the cook” service, nor was the famous satay service made available for this flight departing Bangkok. We were given three options to pre-book our meals – fish, chicken or seafood up to 24 hours before the flight. As we had pre-booked our meal, we were served first before the rest of the Business Class passengers got their food. Food was served at one go as this is a short flight, with fewer drinks and bread options. I chose the Pan Seared Snapper Fillet was well presented on porcelain plates, and the artichoke puree served by the side tasted delicious. The fish is cooked to perfection and still retains its moisture. The appetiser – Smoked Duck Breast, is tasty and not too tough. I did not like the Lemon Cheesecake, not that it is not delicious, just my personal preference. It is a pity that the bread came last after I had finished my meal. But I still enjoyed Singapore Airlines’ signature garlic bread.\n\nI opted for the Pan Seared Snapper Fillet.\nNo welcome pre-departure drinks. We were served plain water in-flight\nMenu for this flight\nSingapore Airlines’ signature Garlic Bread\nService\n\nService in Singapore Airlines felt cold in the Business Class. Besides the standard greeting by the door and “your seat is down this aisle” during boarding, I feel service is no different from that in Economy Class. Bread during meal time took forever to come, served by a male pursuer with a touch-and-go service, who gave me the impression that he was rushing off somewhere. The absence of pre-departure drinks and snacks in Business Class signals cost-cutting measures in the guise of the pandemic. Even during meal service, despite pre-ordering our meal and being served first, there was no attempt to check if we required any drinks; we were being skipped!\n\nDespite the coldness in service, Deniece (I hope I get her name correctly) shines out as the most personable pursuer. She introduced herself to every passenger under her charge and remembered our first names. She was seen patrolling the cabin and checking in with me if I needed anything whenever she walked past my seat and when I was not dozing off. Instead of going for her well-deserved break after the hectic meal service, Deniece would take the initiative to strike up a conversation with me when I was waiting for the loo. Service by Deniece felt personal, which is a stark difference from the rest of the crew onboard this flight.\n\nSingapore Airlines’ regional Business Class product is comfortable and provides various seating options, including a flatbed mode. Not many airlines provide 180 deg flatbed for their regional or short-haul flights. Kudos to Singapore Airlines for doing so. The seat provides passengers with privacy, thanks to its cocoon design. The seat I was in showed some signs of wear and tear, such as the armrest wouldn’t fold down as it was designed to. The large PTV makes watching the endless entertainment options offered by KrisWorld a pleasant experience. The food catering for this leg was delicious, and the fish retained its moisture. The service overall was a tad disappointing. The rest of the pursuers seem not to care about Business Class passengers other than those in their area of responsibility. I do find warmth and sincerity in the service rendered by Deniece. The way she welcomes passengers on the flight memorises and addresses passengers under her charge by their last name and notes passengers’ food allergies.",
                    "We had a delightful experience on Singapore Airlines. The flight attendants were so attentive and accommodating to all our needs throughout this long haul flight. A particular shout-out to Alex, Steph, Kaze, Tim, Zhuona and Zenda for being so amazing! On top of the service, the food, in-flight entertainment and overall cleanliness was superb, and the flight departed and arrived on schedule. Would definitely fly with Singapore Airlines again.",
                    "Overall a good airline and staff are always very good. Premium economy though is a let down in comparison to Airnz.\nOn Singapore it a small section and annoying they keep curtains up separating economy as you use the same toilets.\nFood and drink is the sane also unless you can use book the cook.\nOk seats are better and screen larger. But Airnz certainly win hands down with their offerings.",
                    "The flight is nice with respect to legroom and cleanliness. They provide inadequate food in the flight. Even asking an extra butter by another passenger was responded as unavailable. They are highly limited with food and drinks. The crew also don't service happily instead they get agitated if you raise the light and ask them something. Good if you want to just travel from a source and destination without concerns on food or how crew behaves but not a good overall flight experience.",
                    "Singapore Airlines is the best airline I have ever tried. \n\nThe aircrafts are modern, economy class seats are spacious enough for me (1.87m height), the onboard entertainment provides an ample choice of films, all genres and for all ages. \n\nThe cabin crew is EXCELLENT! I highly appreciate their professionalism, their dedication to provide the highest level of passanger experience. \n\nIn-flight meals are also of high quality and great taste. \n\nThe price of this airline is fair for the quality of the service they provide. Plus the Singapore layover is already an experience which can spice up any travel, to and from any parts of the world! \n\nThank you for the outstanding experience, I am sure to be flying with you again soon!",
                    "none of the flight crews ever offered me a drink. however, i can't help but notice they always offer drinks and attend more to non-asian passengers around me.\nit was just yesterday flight SQ 318",
                    "My previous experience three weeks earlier was a little bit disappointing (BOM-SIN-BKK), however, there were two excellent flights this time: SQ707 BKK-SIN on 26 July and SIN-BOM 31 July. The crew on the SQ707 on 26 July were  exceptional (IFM Geradine, LSS Jane, FSS Gift, FSS Moon & FS Arif), wanted to get their names since great and dedicated work must be recognized.\n\nAs already said, superb crews on both flights, excellent lunch/dinner, and flights on-time. The only gripe is that I don't seem to get a comfortable position on the B777-300ER: the angled position is quite awkward and my back hurts after two hours - prefer the A350 over the B777-300ER. This, of course, is a matter of personal taste only.",

                    "Our first time flying Premium Economy and we were bitterly disappointed!   The seats were slightly larger, but the food was the same as in economy class.  It was disgusting, lukewarm, and served with plastic cutlery.  After the meal service, we hardly saw any of the crew, and wine was not offered again.\nWhen we flew the co-share sector (Sing-Akl) on Air New Zealand, the difference was out of this world.",
                    "The ground crew at Singapore airport behaved like riot police, they were snappy, rude and unhelpful.  Once on the plane, the cabin crew asked anyone who wasn't Western if they were vegetarian, western people were ignored.\nI asked for a glass of water but never received it, and my plate was not cleared away after my meal.\nI thought it might just be the crew on one flight but they were the same on all four flights. The last leg of my journey I sat with two other white women and we were treated appallingly.  In the end we could just look at each other and shrug our shoulders.\nI will never travel with Singapore Airlines again, and would advise any other Western travellers not to use them.",

This was for a $6400 per person ticket. I don’t complain often but for the to be a top rated airline is a joke. I will do my best to never fly them again. I strongly suggest any alternative.",
                    "First: 5 star for flight attendants, always friendly and helpful.\nthen the rest have dropped dramatically\n1: The A350 3x3x3 seats are thin and hard, no room for an average person.\n2: Boarding process was very unorganised.\n3: Quality of food now is terrible.\n4: Disembarking is the worst among all airlines, has to wait at least 10 mins more until all business class passengers to leave then open the curtain.\n5: No longer an punctual airlines.\n6: SilverKris lounge at Changi airport was chaotic, impossible to find a seat.",
                    "Singapore Airlines is one of the best airlines in the world.\n\nWe did several flights with them including this one which was on time.\n\nThe good are the food, beverages, customer service and entertainment which are all excellent.\n\nUnfortunately where this airline and most others fail in the lack of legroom and comfort in economy where they cram in too many customers to improve the bottom line.\n\nOn this long haul flight, for a tall person it is torture and uncomfortable.In future I need to review whether I fly at least premium economy or possibly business next long haul flight.",
                    "I love their in flight entertainment systems, plenty of good movies to watch, easy to navigate too. Food could be better, though. I got the chicken bolognese pasta. Flight attendants are attentive. Checkin and boarding experience were great too.",
                    "My husband and I took two flights with Singapore Airlines for business. We were immediately extremely impressed with the service-also found the in flight entertainment system to be modern and varied. While the food wasn't incredible it was definitely pretty good for plane food. The airport itself was also beautiful and very clean and organized. We were definitely happy with our overall experience and would fly with Singapore Airlines in the future.",
                    "I have wanted to travel on Singapore air for a number of years based on reviews online. I have traveled on most airlines worldwide in first class.  I purchased a full fare first class ticket. It was a waste of money! The aircraft was very clean and the seat was comfortable.  The amenties were cheap and I did not use them.  They presented a menu but most items were not unavailable.  I have never used the service call button while traveling in First for over 24 years. I used it three times on this flight which was 8 hours long.  I chose  the \"order the cook\" meal and the food was awful! There were two passengers that were drunk and extremely loud (I'm surprised they were allowed to board).  The flight crew kept serving them vodka even though many of us asked if there could be something done to help with the extreme noise they were making.  I do not believe I will ever travel on this airline agin.",
                    "Our overnight flight in business class was inferior to other airlines such as Emirates, Qatar, Etihad and Qantas.\n\nOther airlines provide hot towels, pyjamas, amenity kits, mattress for fully flat bed and a turn down service and breakfast. Not Singapore air on this overnight flight from Singapore to Australia. Emirates premium economy is far superior to Singapore Business Class. \n\nSingapore air cannot blame Covid for these petty penny pinching measures, what are they thinking, sadly I have booked with Singapore Air for a trip to Europe in April next year, if things don’t improve, that will be my last.",
                    "Wish I could give them 0 star! I’ve flown with different airlines in business class, but Singapore air is by far the worst. \n\nI traveled from JFK to Frankfurt in business class on September 10. The seat was narrow and terribly uncomfortable. When it’s flat bed, there’s a tiny room for your legs/feet. You need to position your body diagonally in order to lay flat. The food was burned and cold. The flight attendants were so clumsy and unorganized. It’s waste of money and I’d never fly with them again. ",
                    "Traveling back to New Zealand on this flight - had exit row seats in economy on an A380-800. probably seems good on booking but didn't enjoy the space seated in the seat. The seat just didn't seem wide enough? The ability I get straight out and stand up was great, but the nearness to the outlets was a let down. The food was. average to poor and wasn't what I remember pre-COVID. The flight was clean and crew kept the toilets very clean, but a full flight and seems the titles were always in use. In hindsight should have booked a window and aisle seat and hoped no booked the middle seat - lesson learned. Overall I found the standard of service had dropped and wasn't as good.",
                    "My first flight with SQ after 4 years due to Covid. I am really disappointed with the food. The taste is bad and there was no fruit. Breakfast was not served either. There were also no toys and games provided for children anymore. If this is the standard SIA is maintaining, I will reconsider flying with them in future",
                    "I was looking forward to trying the new seats on this flight, as pre covid, I have only flown in the original ones.  \n\nI was in 14K on the A380 from SIN-FRA-JFK\n\nThe design looks great, the space was great, and the privacy also amazing.  But christ it's uncomfortable.  Way too hard - even after just sitting for take off and the meal service I was feeing it.  Then as a bed (I'm 6ft), although the small foot section was cramped, and my knees kept bashing the corners ... it's the rock hard seat again that makes this terrible.  \n\nBack to Qantas or BA I go now ... \n\nOh and one last bug bear ... why the hell do they think it's a good idea to come around and start putting the seats into upright landing position an hour before landing!!",
                    "This was a very disappointing experience considering the hype around the SQ soft and hard product in business.  Firstly let me say the Silverkris Lounge at Changi T3 was excellent. It was the highlight of my flight.  Normally the lounge is just the teaser with the inflight experience the main event.  Unfortunately the inflight experience was just disappointing.  At pre-departure I was offered a juice or champagne and I asked for water.  The FA literally told me to just drink from my water bottle.  No big deal but just not the right tone to set in a premium cabin.  Then there is the seat.  I flew the a380 with their new a380 business seats which i just didn’t like.  I found the seat uncomfortable and the seat padding pretty hard.  Their seat configuration was just really limited and the seat buttons very unresponsive when pressing them.  This was a night flight and this seat is just a terrible for sleeping.  The design when in flat bed mode forces you to lie on an angle  which was very awkward and uncomfortable.   The “seat cover” provided was very thin and no padding meaning you felt all the padding and upholstery of the seat which was just not very soft or giving.  The blanket provided was just too small and meant that either my arms or my feet were sticking out the entire time.  The seat looks good but for me was a total functional fail for comfort and awful for sleeping.  Sadly the food service was a real let down on this flight as well.  I “booked the cook” for my meal which certainly raised my expectations but what I got was average, bland  noodles that looked no different from the other inflight offerings.  My travel companion took the inflight breakfast offering and this was literally one of the worst meals not just in business but in any cabin class.  The scrambled eggs were quite literally inedible.  A goopy stream of “bits” of egg that must surely have been powdered or reconstituted egg,  It was just disgusting.  Totally unbelievable offering on a business class flight.  Whilst the flight was on time and the FAs polite and efficient I would not fly SQ business again unless it was a discounted ticket and I would be very hesitant even then to book a night flight on the a380 with this seat.",
                    "Chefs must have had a laugh whilst choosing meals to serve economy class for dinner. For your own health and wellbeing, make sure you eat well before any flight from Singapore to India so as to prevent yourself from forcing down a meal fit for prisoners. So rarely is a travel experience so astronomically diabolic that I find myself constructing a review on tripadvisor. \nPlease take my advice with utter and utmost care.",
                    "It's taken a long time before I could bring myself to write this review, such was my level of disappointment with this airline. My husband had recently retired and this was our retirement gift to ourselves after years of working and raising a family. Needless to say, we paid a small fortune. To begin our sad tale, due to some glitch, we weren't seated together so we travelled all the way to Paris one behind the other.  There was no personal amenities pack - you had to ask for a sleeping mask, socks, toothbrush and toothpaste.  The aircraft was old, the food was only just edible and the blanket was smelly. Service was not what I expected -  we were invisible until they were collecting rubbish.  On the return flight, I had a bit of chest congestion and I asked the attendant for a sick bag and when she brought it, she told me to take it to the toilet when I was finished with it. The last straw was a meal that was supposed to be a beef stir fry but it was a dried up stew arrangement that was completely grey in colour. This was definitely not my expectation of Business Class, and, as we are 71 and 69 years of age, I think they could have done better. We have flown with this airline on numerous occasions but I will never, ever do it again. I know that my absence won't make much difference to their annual profit but I feel better for having made that decision.",
                    "Having flown in from PER on a relatively short flight in a 787 we found ourselves in a decrepit A350 for a 7hour flight.\nAV was outdated, not intuitive & provided zero news channels & staff not very interested to find one. On the way from PER I was watching BBC News broadcast out of their Singapore studios ??\nThere was however a basic instruction clip for the seating so found the missing 787 armrest.\nGood food service, first hot meal of the day as breakfast out of PER was barely warm.  BUT, a lousy wine selection to pair with my boeuf vigneron by George Blanc. No trace of a French vigneron red, except in the meal ! Just a Chianti & Barossa Shiraz for the reds & 2 whites. I had a better selection on QF BNE/PER !!\nWhat is the point of a G Blanc menu if you skimp on the wine ?\nCrew lightweight on product knowledge, no idea about G Blanc & not interested in the AV issues.\nIt would appear adequate training is missing  --  How the mighty have fallen !",
                    "This was the BEST flight out of 3 to reach our final destination after 20 hours of being on a plane. My father in law has a disability and Singapore Air was READY with a wheelchair and to assist compared to the United flights we took that made us WAIT to board cause they’re was no help ready when we booked it AND confirmed over the phone prior to our 30 hour flight overseas. It was truly frustrating. I’m so THANKFUL we ended the trip with Singapore airlines to our final destination of Cambodia as the staff was RESPECTFUL, truly compassionate, polite and professional. THANK YOU to Steven, Candace, Najwa, Fadhill, Syafiqah, and Lynette as I wish we knew and chose the airline on our longer flight overseas. Will definitely fly Singapore air when traveling overseas!",
                    "A dirty and disgusting airplane, all forgotten that we still live in time where hygiene should be your top priority. \nThis flight range on the same level as low cost carriers flying domestically in 3rd world countries.  Leftover items and used socks, used headset and crumbles all over the seat and on the floor.  \nSQ, this has to be much better if you want to compete to be one of the leading airlines.  \n1 star is all I can give for this flight, and that only because the crew was nice and friendly.",
                    "Although the tickets were a few hundred euros more expensive than other airlines, we booked a return flight from Munich to Singapore since we expected high standards from Singapore Airlines. But we were extremely disappointed with the provided service. These were the main issues:\n\n1. Food & Drinks: \nThe food  was insufficient (no snacks, etc). The lunch/dinner was served at the beginning of the flight, and \"nothing but water\" was given for the next 8-9 hours until the breakfast was served! I have never experienced hunger during a flight but this one which led to severe stomach pain. Therefore, I could not even eat the breakfast and left the plane and started my journey in a miserable state. \n\nThe food was also of poor quality and incompatible with public taste. The prawns served with coconut rice were so spicy that eating them was unbearable. A lady in my row had to ask for some milk to help her tongue from burning.\n\nWater was only served in small plastic cups, and there were no bottles of water provided for the passengers for such a long (11+ hours) journey! No other beverages were served between the main courses. And when I asked for the whole can of coke while serving the food, the staff refused my request.\n\n2. Check-in:\nSingapore Airlines are partners with Lufthansa. They referred us to check-in with Lufthansa (since the first leg of our journey was operated by Lufthansa), but Lufthansa did not allow us to check-in either and referred us to Singapore Airlines. Ultimately, it was impossible for us to check-in online because of this ridiculous circle they both created.\n\nOn our departure flight from Singapore, we were waiting for more than an hour in the check-in queue at the airport since a few check-in counters were operating and they were unbelievably slow. \n\n3. Comfort:\nThe seats were very uncomfortable, and I have flown lots of long-haul flights with different airlines in economy. \n\nI am sorry that I chose Singapore Airlines to fly with, and I'll never fly with this airline again.",
                    "I m travelling  Singapore Airline exclusive for this route for many years. Something has changed within airline. It saddens me to say we had  very old aircraft, entertainment device quality, seats itself, food served and service is the worst I have experienced ever. \nIn fact lounge access for Priority Pass was denied because apparently airlines have booked it all. Unbelievable! \n\nIt seems Singapore Airlines is taking its loyal customer for granted.",
                    "This experience started with the Lounge at Bangkok airport. Here it is very peaceful, plenty of appetising food and a good selection of beverages.\n\nA wheelchair service was again provided.\n\nThe flight from Bangkok to Singapore was extremely pleasant, the crew was extremely friendly and seemed to have a close bond with each other, great to see.\n\nOur food was pre-selected but well below our expectations, the only downer on this trip.",
                    "Wow the absolute best. Spent about 40 hours with this airline within the last 2 weeks and have been so well taken care of. Great food on every flight, no delays, incredible cabin crew, spacious and comfortable, great movies and snacks upon snacks! 🙌🏻🙌🏻 sooooo glad I chose this airline",
                    "First time flying these guys since 2019. Still a solid airline, but things have gone downhill. Food portions were tiny! They say this is because of Covid, but would I really be more likely to catch Covid if I had jam to spread on my dry breakfast roll, or an entree before the minuscule main meal, like there used to be? Most of it is cost cutting blamed on Covid. \n\nOur plane was changed to a different type and new seats were automatically assigned. I was unable to change them online. I had paid for seat selection on the original plane. Needless to say I'm still waiting for a refund.\n\nI was impressed by the crew though - all of them were very friendly and helpful, and did a great job dealing with an unruly passenger who was refusing to wear a mask. I hope they get paid well for having to deal with that kind of attitude.",

The problem became apparent when spending 40 minutes trying to find the Kris Flyer lounge. Very poor signage. The seats on the A350-900 were comfortable and the on board welcome lived up to expectations. From there the service went downhill, the food was mediocre at best, the service not much better. For amenities we were given a mask and a tube of sanitisation gel. The flight duration was 15 hours during which we were given one small bottle of mineral water. In the past SAA we’re the gold standard  in in flight service but unfortunately on this flight they are living on past glories.",
                    "Oh how the Premium Economy (PE) service has dropped on Singapore Airlines (SA) - not good compared to other PE serviced airlines. In PE you pay extra (a lot extra) this normally includes individual welcoming, a hot towelette and in many cases a drink prior to takeoff.  None of this on SA it was an extraordinary amount clutter and confusion through out the PE cabin. One alcohol drink prior to meal service with there wine pours being half a small plastic glass , no offered alcohol drink at meal service, meals through \"Book the Cook\" were not good at all but oh offered plenty of glasses of water throughout trip. Come on SA what has happened to your past extraordinary service that was legendary.  Folks if you choose to have a little more comfort and service, choose another airline as Singapore Air has chosen to be a just another mediocre airline.",

                    "Flew Frankfurt to Adelaide with transit in Singapore. We are frequent flyers with another airline and were absolutely shocked at the poor service by Singapore Airlines. Our flight tickets cost $5,500 each for economy! On our first leg (12.5 hours) we were offered 1 meal within the first hour after takeoff then absolutely nothing, not even a beverage for the next 8 hours! I went down to the cabin crew to ask for food and was only offered a fun pack size chips and snack size Kitkat! We were then served an extremely small breakfast meal just before landing. Couldn’t believe the cost cutting! Four times the price and no food nor service. In the second leg (6.5 hours) we weren’t offered a single thing, not even a beverage until 1 hour before landing when we were hurriedly served a tiny breakfast. Absolute shame on Singapore Airlines taking advantage of Aussie citizens trying to return home. Stealing money and starving their passengers who are spending days travelling just to get back!",

                    "After around 2 years, when the world was brought to its knees during the pandemic that devastates travel world as well, I and my family finally had a chance to once again experienced the renown Singapore Airlines services, including its safety (that's how much I still trust how SQ does a proper maintenance for its widerange fleet during the pandemic when all flights  were halted or reduced to almost nothing). It was a long-haul -+16 hours flight from Singapore to US eastern seabed city (a direct flight to NYC) and to our sincere surprise, SIA Cabin Crew have never lost their touch. The warmth personal engagement to the passengers as its signature high quality service remains intact, even after a terrible slow down of travel around the world. That is what we were longing to encounter as it used to be since our last flight from Australia in Jan 2020, right before the pandemic took its grip and many memorable amazing flights with Singapore Airlines.\n\nThe only difference probably the new norm of health safety measure implemented on the service procedure. We see the Crew with face shield, mask, gloves when serving and how the restrooms were cleaned more often than pre-pandemic. It was a real hard work which shows their tremendous commitment to their high standard service, a class of its own by Singapore Airlines. \n\nThat could be a biased opinion due to being Singaporeans ourselves, but one can not avoid to be amazed and continue to be convinced that SQ will continue to fly high, bring their guests to wherever it may take and leave an unforgettable mark in their hearts with the excellent service by its Crew.\n\nWe are aware as well the not-so-good part of SQ stories caused by pandemic whereas some, if not many, of the Crew left or probably were let go by SIA due to one reason or another, but it is heart-warming to see how the Crew in our first flight (SQ 24 – 26 Dec 2021) were in action in happiness and commitment. It started with Ken Tan (Mr.) as Inflight Manager, Cabin Crew Division, who warmly greeted my family onboard and continued by Ms. Lynn (CS), Ms. Andrea (FSS), Ms. Evelyn (FSS), Ms. Christy (FSS), Ms. Tini (FSS), Mr. Arif (FS), who served the row (windows) where my family sat. Special mention for Ms. Andrea, Ms. Lynn and Ms. Sow Lee Cheng who kept watching our comfort during the flight, offering snacks, drinks, served our meals, had a chat with my daughter, helped made up the bed, being disturbed by me for drinks in the night, and so on. Wish them all the best and brighter days with SQ and hope all these mess due to infamous covid-19 will be gone and it will never missed. Only the Cabin Crew with its dedication which will be missed.

Being free to stretch my legs as much as I wished as well as being able to simply walk off to visit the washroom outweighed the slighly annoying requirment to have my inflight entertainment system stowed during take-off and landing (as compared to other passengers with seat-back systems).  \n\nI was glad to see flat trays (rather than heat-retentive boxes, or were the latter only for short flights) were used for meals.  The 'chicken and rice' option (actually a sort of briyani) was rather tasty although a little more meat would have been ideal.  The crew also did well keeping everyone hydrated, as well as the toilets clean, throughout the flight.

I walked in with positive expectations, but I walked away very disappointed.\n\nSingapore Airlines is really overrated. First, the seats in the economy class are extremely uncomfortable, both in terms of cushion and size. It's very narrow, making you feel like are packed in a sardine can. For flights longer than 6 hrs, it's pure torture. Second, the foods served in economy class, are lower than what you might find at McDonald's. The inflight service is also overrated. The flight attendants (FA) are very robotic. They'd put on a polite smile and respond to your request in a very artificial, insincere ways. And this gets worse with head FAs. What may you see on Singapore Airlines commercials/advertisements are not the reality. The aircraft cabin environment in the economy class can make you feel like you are on a Greyhound bus, if not worse. Furthermore, most Singapore Airlines flights converge to Singapore (because it's their hub). And the airport itself (SIN), is also grossly overrated. It may look sort of \"modern\", but there many little \"stupid\" things that they can improve on such as flight information monitors availability and accessibility. \n\nOverall, Singapore Airlines would *not* be my future choice of airlines for my travel. The ratio of bang-for-buck is not high enough to justify for the extra bucks you'd have cough out for flying with Singapore Airlines.",

This was a very poor service. \n\nWe got to the airport and had to check in at the desk due to this issue which meant online check in couldn't be done. We were in premium economy which was spacious, two seats on either side of the plane and 3 seats in the middle. The plane seemed relatively new but not brand new. Legroom was good, seats were wider and had bigger arm rest in between the two seats which had the fold away tray tables in. There was a good choice of movies and other things such as TV shows, games etc. The food was ok, didn't seem to be much different from economy standard. The flight crew seemed friendly enough. They didn't really go up and down the isles with drinks only maybe twice for the whole 13-14 hour flight, which on other airlines they would have done it quite often.\n\nOverall the flight was ok, seats were comfy, legroom good. Food was ok. The flight crew could have been more attentive especially with it being premium economy, you would expect the service to be slightly better than economy.",
                    "Paid for a Premium Economy ticket,  an extra $1000 per ticket. Narrow seats only wider armrest. Footrest not supportive and very uncomfortable during trip. \nTo top it of they put us in economy from Singapore to Hanoi Vietnam.\nNo lounge for Premium Economy, only Business class.\nOverall would not recommend the extra cost.",
                    "Phenomenal , immaculate onboard service provided by IFM Paul Tan, LS Jamal and FSS Anchakoran!  18.5 hours flight that this crew made it enjoyable with their gracious demeanour.",

                    "What can I say?  It was amazing even if we're sitting in economy class.  Very accommodating especially with my son who has special needs. \n However, if you booked your flight to a travel agent, Singapore Airlines-MNL, is useless.  They do not want to touch our booking.  I want our seat to be upgraded and they can not do anything.  Also, they have the worst food.",

                    "Singapore Air Arrogance and Bad Services \n\nI would rate myself as a reasonable frequent flyer, having traveled in Asia at least 4-6 times a month and long haul at lest 1-3 times a quarter prior to Covid. Over the past 14 years I have always made it a point to fly Singapore Airways because of there outstanding service, and of loyalty shown its customers in the past, this is with the exception of the past 4+ years.  Over the past 4 years I have gone out off my way to avoid flying SingaporeAir, choosing any other airline but SingaporeAir due to the following reasons :\n\n1. The arrogance of ground staff \n2. The quality and state of the lounges \n3. The total lack off service and complacency from ground and checkin staff\n4. The difficulties in making changes to bookings\n5. The lack of long term customer loyalty recognition.\n6. The pure greed \n\nOver the past 4 years I have written to SingaporeAir multiple times, relating to my bad experiences with a standard response “thank you for your letter/email your concerns are being addressed and we will get back to you”. To date I haven’t heard a word from SingaporeAir, not surprisingly given there arrogance. Once again I have tried SingaporeAir, and guess what?  “surprisingly it has got worse”.\n\nI have recently (4+ years) been flying Qatar Air and have found the service, willingness to help, loyalty to frequent flying customers exceptional and the overall flying experience to be much better then SingaporeAir.  \n\nIf you are flying long haul I will strongly recommend you try QatarAirlines and avoid SingaporeAir at all cost.",

                    "I recently travelled with Singapore Airlines to Singapore/London from Sydney and return. Whilst flights SQ242 and SQ221 were reasonable my flights SQ306 and SQ321 between Singapore and London were dreadful. \nI am a pensioner, doing occasional casual work, and it has taken quite a while to save up for this trip. As I have arthritis and I'm 75 years old, I persuaded my travelling companion to book premium economy. On previous trips, with Cathay and Air Canada, I had been upgraded to premium economy and found it to be much more comfortable than being in economy.\n\nI cannot understand why Singapore Airlines thinks that the Boeing 777 is suitable for premium economy, and I feel exploited. The seating was so cramped that you could hardly get out of your seat to reach the aisle. When the person in front reclined their seat movement was almost impossible. How is this better than economy?\n\nOn the flight over my t.v. screen malfunctioned for 3 hours and I could not watch anything!! The flight crew did everything they could to fix it and after all that time they finally did.\n On the return flight I could not recline my seat which made it very uncomfortable trying to sleep.\nAdditionally, on this flight, the middle toilet seemed to be out of use, so we had to walk to the very rear of the plane. In fact, we had to walk further to a toilet than anyone else on the plane! I was very unimpressed given the huge amount of money we paid for premium economy.\n\nI have been fortunate to have travelled several times in my life, and this experience with Singapore Airlines was the worst travel experience I have had with an airline. This is more so because I expected more, given the amount I and my friend paid for premium economy. I did expect it to be better than economy.\n\nI might also add that when I tried to log in to Kris Flyer in the plane I could not do so.\nAlmost everything was unsatisfactory but the very cramped space and poor value for the dollar were the worst. Given that Singapore Airlines was recently named as the world’s top airline, I would have to strongly disagree. My only positive opinion relates to the ease of checking in and the pleasantness of the flight crew.\nSingapore Airlines has not replied to my last email, which I guess is what you would expect!",
                    "This was my first time flying with Singapore Airlines, but it won't be my last! They made a 15 hour flight \"fly\" by. With all the entertainment and food/drink options, you aren't bothered by how long your flight may be.",
                    "my first disappointment was that the fish meal served after taking off was way below my expectation.  The fish tasted and smelled bad.  The rice was colored blue for reason I do not understand, and it also tasted bad. (Perhaps the color turned off my tastebud and I missed the real taste?) For the second meal before landing, I selected chicken rice.  The chicken meat was cooked so hard that I only ate a couple piece and gave up the rest.  The rice was just too plain to be called chicken rice.  I ate a small amount of rice and had no more appetite.  Singapore airline needs to do a better job controlling the food quality.  \nOn this flight I found the pillow to be a problem.  At first I put it behind my back.  But it was uncomfortable. So I left it on my lap, but after a while it fell off to the floor, so I pushed it under the seat in front of me.  I could have gotten rid of it if the flight attendant had noticed that it was useless for me.  \nIn general, I hardly see any flight attendants checking the condition of passengers and observing if they need any services.",
                    "I've already given my horrific experience trying to rebook my flights but now that I took these flights, I wanted to provide additional feedback.  My experience flying 16 and then 14 hours from Vancouver to Singapore and back is that the level of service is very poor.  On a 16 hour flight, we received two very small meals ... in between you could order cup noodle or (as I did) a very small sandwich that in my case was soggy like it had been sitting in water (just gross).  On the way back (14 hour flight) again, only two small meals and the flight attendant blew by me with the drinks so I had to ask specifically for some water.  Drinks were never offered the rest of the flight until towards the second meal ... hardly anyone coming by with water ... also something you had to request.  Bathrooms were also quite dirty towards the end of the flight.  Staff didn't seem keen on cleaning them.  Have experienced much better service with Lufthansa and other airlines.  Won't be rushing back to Singapore Airline anytime soon",
                    "We traveled on EVA from Canada to get to Phuket.  We were booked by our travel agent to go to Singapore.  Although we only took a short 2.5 hour flight, the service from Singapore Airlines was wonderful.  Our flight left on time with great service and even a meal was served during our flight which surprised us as the flight was short.  They even offered wine several times during the flight. The plane was smaller and seats not as comfortable as it was more of an “air bus”but for the time spent it was fine.",
                    "The Boeing 737-800 had a business class cabin for 12. The seats must have been taken from a provincial bus somewhere in the 1970s and bolted onto the floor of this aircraft. They had no redeeming feature. The recline was almost unnoticeable, The footrest had to be brought up 6 inches from the floor by manually pulling on a lever that seemed obstinate. We had bulkhead seats - there was zero stowage; the pillow and the blanket were in our laps (unless we put them behind our backs and made our ride more uncomfortable than it already was). The entertainment system comprised an iPad with headphones. \nThe food choice was limited, and the wines even more limited. One red (a cheap Chianti) and one white was all that was available. \nThis was a 5-hour flight that was uncomfortable from beginning to end - to put it mildly. Couldn't wait to land in Kathmandu. And this was after paying more than $3,000 each for a Manila-Kathmandu-Manila ticket (via Singapore), Shocking!\nWe chose NOT to fly on this aircraft on the return journey; didn't make much sense in sitting bolt upright for 5 hours at night when a business class seat should be offering you some semblance of lie-flat.\nNever again! This was a complete rip off.",
                    "Overall decent flight. Super long queue at Heathrow but check in itself was pretty smooth. Attentive and accommodating crew.",

                    "Singapore airlines is only acceptable so long as you have no changes to your flight.  My first flight to connect to my Singapore flight was late.  Alaska Airlines called, texted, and emailed Singapore Airlines to coordinate my late departure.  No one at Singapore airlines would even pick up the phone.  So by the time I arrived, and Arrived at the gate 10 minutes after the scheduled departure - there was not a soul around.  Alaska Airlines informed me that my bags did not make it in the plane, so I had to collect my belongings, find a hotel and then try to rebook.  Again, Singapore airlines was zero help.  I finally purchased a flight on United Airlines where I can talk to a human being who helped me out and was able to fly to Singapore for about a third of the cost of Singapore Airlines.\nSo, in summary, fly someone else.  It will be cheaper, easier, and more relaxing.",
                    "We were offered the choice of carriers from England to Vietnam and chose this airline on the basis of a friend's recommendation and that he had been impressed when he had last used them. Priority check-in went smoothly, however the friendliness of the staff left a lot to be desired. The lounge was clean, tidy and a full selection of hot and cold meals and liquid refreshments provided.\nThe flight to Singapore was very comfortable with a large seating area where you could fully stretch out, however some of the cabin crew gave the impression that explaining the various controls and screen changes was beneath them. The menu was good  and the meals were tasty. The lounge again was average, however noise and distractions from other traveller's spoilt the ambience.\nFrom Singapore to Vietnam the cabin crew were attentive and extremely responsive. This was a slightly smaller airliner, however the seating arrangements were adequate.\nThe return trip was basically similar to the inward journey, but the cabin staff were perhaps more attentive due to it being mainly a night flight and they had more time to devote to each passenger.\nThe central seating means that it is almost impossible to have a conversation with your \"flying\" partner due to the distance between parties. Each passenger is provided with headphones, blanket, cushion, socks and footwear, however the entertainment choice is severely limited.\ni was led to believe that the trip would be memorable, but the hype did not match the reality.",
                    "Four flights - Brisbane to Singapore to Phuket and return.  Absolutely dreadful experience.  Still have PTSD from the final flight!  Firstly, the food trays in economy are not to be messed with.  They sit so low on the seat in front that when you open them out they sit on your stomach at an angle that allows the food/drinks to slide off.  Also no complimentary packs as was once the case.  I was looking forward to those little slippers they used to give you – nada - but that's ok because the seat in front of you is so close that to bend down to put them on you more than likely would give yourself concussion when your head hits said seat.  It also felt like they had managed to squeeze in another four rows of seats at the expense of comfort and ease for passengers. \n\nFood on all flights was inedible but the final flight's food (departed Singapore around 12.45 am) was non-existent - nothing was offered except water and juice until approximately 7 am when baked beans and an egg was served.  Who serves baked beans to a plane load of passengers? The toilets are busy enough without the added fibre of a baked bean meal.  Can't complain about the service because there was nothing to serve.  I really felt like I was flying with some sort of budget airline instead of one that I paid quite a bit of money for.  Singapore Airlines once had a fantastic reputation and I was looking forward to flying with them.  I certainly won't be flying with them again.  It’s obviously all about the bottom dollar now and not flying experience for passengers.",
                    "After years of hearing of the legendary Singapore Airlines I moved my travel over from Qantas. What a mistake!\nMy first trip with them (Sydney-Paris return): Sydney lounge was small and cramped, worn-out, dark and depressing. The food was so bad I couldn't go near it; drinks luke warm; air-conditioning broken down. Instead we chose to wait at the gate for 2 hours instead of the SIA hell hole of a lounge.\n\nPlanes were old and worn out; service with a fake smile; food inedible. The seats and surfaces had not been cleaned despite their constant announcement of cold-cleaning: surfaces had finger marks all over the screen and table. The Business lounge in Singapore was so over-crowded there were not 2 seats for us to sit together (this for a cost of AUD $20,000 for both of us). Next leg as bad as the first. \nOn the return flight they ran out of champagne so we weren't able to have a 2nd glass (no big deal but it indicates the pathetic level of service). Again transitting at Singapore Business no 2 seats to sit together. Long queues for food options - I ended up sitting in a chair in a bust thoroughfare with a sandwich wrapped in plastic (again, this for  a cost of AUD $20,000). Add the arrogance behind the smiles when I complained and the final result is one of the worst airlines I have experienced in many year of travel. Dishonest, misleading marketing which needs to be called out for what it is: fraudulent.",

                    "I don't expect a great deal of comfort when flying economy and in this regard the flight met my expectations. The seat was extremely uncomfortable and cramped. I am a small person and even so the seat and leg room did not afford any comfort. I was allocated a seat amongst families with three infants, which was unfair to me and the families. Service was very poor. The cabin crew were not interested in passengers and systems were disorganized. My husband was skipped at breakfast time ... simply ignored. He thought they must be serving the other row only and going to come back to him. He had to request breakfast in the end. It was difficult to get water. I booked through star alliance network which made managing the Singapore Airlines part of my journey, with seat select etc difficult. I will not fly Singapore Airlines again.",
                    "When we arrived at the airport to check in our bags there was a reasonable line of people waiting at the bag check in counters for the airline. This went down reasonably quick. The person who checked our bags in didn't seem to have the best attitude that you would generally expect to receive. \n\nBoarding the plane wasn't overly bad, the crew seemed friendly and helpful. The seats weren't too bad. There was a good choice of films and some TV programs, To access the games you have to have an account. The food wasn't too bad, did receive one meal which didn't seem to have been cooked properly so had to get to swapped. The crew came round with drinks fairly regularly and if you wanted anything you could just go to the back of the plane and ask.  The hygiene felt better as not flying since covid we were concerned a bit.  Overall the plane seemed newer, the crew friendly and helpful. \n\nFor the return journey, there wasn't any people really waiting to check baggage in, it seems to be self bag check in. The staff on hand to help with checking the baggage in were very helpful. Boarding the plane wasn't too bad and the crew seemed friendly. The plane seemed to be older and more worn as panels especially in the toilets were badly cracked and also the hygiene of the plane didn't seem to be as good as the outward flight. \n\nThe entertainment was the same as the outward flight. The crew occasionally came round with drinks. The food was ok. Overall the crew were friendly",

Not here.   \n\nAnd you are suffocating with masks in a stuffy hot waiting area (and on board). These non-N95 masks do little to prevent anything (half the meetings I just had in Singapore had locals who were suffering from COVID, but I it had been a while since someone in my US world was sidelined).  Further, do the epidemiological work of looking at how hyper clean airplane environments provide cleaner air than anything, except perhaps for 100% wearers of N95 masks—and even that is not clear (and, BTW, look around at all the people who are constantly pretending to eat and drink to avoid wearing a mask—who then really believes that masks are doing anything). \n\nThis is probably a good—maybe great—airline for coach. But for people who pay premium, LET ME OUT of the COVID theater that somehow forgot about the people who pay a little bit extra. \n\nAnd BTW, I am a liberal Democrat who happens to be a fact-based scientist who realizes we need to find a balance between living and an hyper-controlled environment that has kept me from even getting a common cold in the last 3 years.",
                    "What happened to this airline?? What used to be stellar service has become a worn out effort of \"fake-smile\" service by a tired crew. Friendly but that's it. No amenity bags, no coat hanging and the most lousy meal service we have experienced on any airline in the last 5 years. In business class! below enconmy class standard of other airlines. On our four flights our meal choice was \"out\". Food quality  was so bad we tasted it and didn't finis it. All on one plate, no starter or desert cart. Moderately comfortable seats in the 350-900. Seat comfort in their new \"short-haul\" 787-10 is a joke however. How is it possible to completely disregard passenger comfort in a 1-2-1 seating arrangement?? SIA manages to do exactly that. A cramped and claustrophobic seat, impossible to eat comfortably as the seat tray is as challenging as in economy. What a downfall. And I almost forgot: now they are running late as the other airlines. Never again",
                    "Travelled with Singapore on their premium economy service. This was supposed to be the industry standard and the photos looked great. \nPre flight- this was ok, bag drop was to a specific lane but the promised priority boarding was poor, on the way out it was separated, bit at changing on the way back there was no separation between economy and premium.\n\nSeats - I have been flying a long time, and the seats are the same width as the economy of 20 years ago. Still far better than current economy, but not brilliant. As some controls for the entertainment system were on the inside of the seat armrests, anything in your pocket would catch and operate them. They were comfortable enough but had an irritating headrest which kept sliding down, so they started in position but then slid down becoming uncomfortable.\n\nEntertainment system- really good choices, BUT there are headphones provided which had special 3 prong fitting, so if you brought your own you can’t use them!! The headphones are average quality with little noise cancellation so making the whole thing pretty useless.\n\nCabin- on the A380 outward, the cabin was forward and was separated from economy and business by a curtain, with a dedicated toilet. On the way back in a 777-300 it was a small area which was separated from business but there was no separation from economy toilets were at the back of economy and generally had a long wait. The lack of premium benefits were clear from disembarking, as on the way out priority exit happened, but on the way back only business got off first.with everyone else lumped together, no premium aspect at all.\n\nService- This was perhaps the most disappointing, outward journey was not as good as any other airlines premium economy, or even Qatars basic economy. As was made clear, Premium was not in fact given any premium benefits, it was just economy with slightly bigger seats - even TUI did this better. Got off the flight outbound dehydrated, didn’t see much of any flight attendant after meal service.\n\nFood - Book the cook was the only premium benefit here, everything else was the same as economy, right down to the wooden cutlery on the outbound journey. The food was ok. Not good, just ok. Again Qatar and TUI did this MUCH better.\n\nSummary- Double the price for slightly bigger seats and a quick bag drop. That’s it. \nInterestingly Scoot plus was significantly better in all departments, which is supposed to be the economy arm of Singapore airlines!\n\nI would suggest using another airline, Premium does not mean premium on Singapore, they have not got the balance right. I find it ridiculous that the service and product from TUI which is a holiday company is far superior than the supposedly industry leader. Not even close to Qatar…..\n\nDo better Singapore Airlines",

After flying many airlines (including, in recent times, Emirates and Qantas), I found that the crew on this flight were exceptional in their service. They apologised to me for delay with the meals...even though this was due to them giving exceptional service to those who had special dietary requirements. Many thanks to the flight crew  on SQ232 on 25 August from Sydney. I enjoyed the in flight entertainment, and did suggest to SA that they might consider perhaps some additional language lessons in addition to the Spanish lesson provided as part of the in flight entertainment (perhaps Mandarin, Cantonese, and even Malay - wonderful to know to give some respect to the wonderful people of Singapore and Malaysia). Ten points to you all.",

Since a lot of flight paths are no longer being serviced one of the few options of travelling this route is to fly from Perth to Singapore (flight duration ~ 5 hrs), enjoy a 3 hour layover in the stunning Changi airport, and then fly from Singapore to Johannesburg (flight duration ~ 11 hrs). We travelled this route for the first time in Feb 2022 and I can honestly say it was such an enjoyable experience flying on Singapore Airlines. I have travelled on South African Airways, Air New Zealand, Air Asia, Qantas (as well as a few domestic only operated airlines) and none of them compare to the service offered on Singapore Airlines. Staff (from check-in to in-flight) are SO lovely and are happy to cater to your every need. Food is 10/10, especially since we pre-book Muslim meals and are usually quite underwhelmed on other airlines but Singapore Airlines meals was SOOOOO GOOD!  In-flight entertainment was also a plus and seats were comfortable and reclined quite a bit (yes even in economy!). Although the trip is longer without a direct flight, I am more than happy to book Singapore Airlines again and again. Overall, experience was 11/10.

They do not provide a dinner meal on the SA 305 route from LHR to Singapore or the connecting flight to Sydney SA 241.

The SA 241 leg was unsatisfactory with poor meals very limited service in economy, no water and soiled toilets from early in the flight. They felt it was more like a budget flight..ie..Scoot with a SA logo. Seems you either pay for PE or BC or your really are in cattle class with Singapore..so very disappointing that SA has followed QANTAS down the cheap and nasty route!\nUnfortunately, given past good experiences wit SA my Wife and I have booked with SA to go to Europe next year! Will have to review that decision!",
                    "Return flight to London, again in Premium Economy. This time is was almost all flown in daylight as opposed to overnight going out. Changi is an amazing airport and we sailed through all aspects to get to the gate. However the man directing boarding with his microphone was completely illegible (it did make most of the passengers laugh though) and so boarding turned into a bit of a bun fight.\n\nIt was a 24 seat Premium Economy cabin as going out so had the same pros and cons. It was full, as Business appeared to be too but Economy was only about three quarters full.\n\nThe cabin crew were only marginally more visible during this flight as they did a drinks service just after take off unlike the overnight flight going out. It all felt portion controlled, even BA are more generous with their pours and selection. However, if a drink you wanted was not on the trolley they made a note and returned a short while later with it. \n\nWe did 'book the cook' again which expanded our meal choice considerably with more Western dishes. The first meal was quite good actually. There was no dessert on the meal tray but the crew came round with ice cream when the meal service was almost over. \n\nAfter the first meal service, the masked cabin crew disappeared again and were barely seen until the second meal service. However, like the outgoing flight, came quickly if summoned and were polite and efficient. The female cabin crew appeared more friendly than the male cabin crew, who were rather officious and abrupt (and there were quite a few of them).\n\nThe entertainment was the same as going out, so a very good selection. However, there appeared to be glitches in the system on this flight as we noticed quite a few reboots going on around us. My screen did freeze quite often which caused losses in sound which spoiled the viewing somewhat. The extensive music channels were fine.\n\nThe second meal was served rather sooner than expected, there were still about five hours to go when the cabin crew magically reappeared. It was a 'book the cook' option again but not as nice as our first meal. \n\nAs with the outward flight, the toilets deteriorated as the flight progressed (and this time non too fragrant!). Paper towels ran out again as did facial tissues.\n\nAgain we took off on time and landed early which was good.",
                    "A great flight on this first class airline. On time and business cabin was great. Cabin crew could not be better. Food exceptional. Highly recommended ",
                    "Generally excellent but on both flights there was no wifi service, and the food was provided on used/recycled meal trays that had lost their anti-slip feet. They slid like teflon across the fold down seat tray. Luckily we had no disasters but this is totally unacceptable- imagine if you ended up with a hot cup of coffee or curried fish all over your white trousers. Please check and repair trays before reusing them!",

All I got in return was a voucher that I had to spend their airline for 75 Singapore dollars, I browsed their inventory hoping to find some to use this voucher on and basically all I can buy is a bottle of vodka or kids stuff which I have I have no interest in. I complained via email telling them I sat on the plane looking at a blank screen for the duration of my flight and think a 75 Singapore dollar voucher is poor and I would like a upgrade flying back or a bigger voucher amount, they literally just emailed me back saying sorry the staff was unfriendly and that’s the voucher we give to solve this type of issue, so basically deal with it. \nI will never fly them again, my whole family on the flight expressed the same when it came to the service. They do not deserve the awards they have ",
                    "We flew coach class from SFO to Bangkok in November 2021. We found that Singapore Airlines was not the airline of old. It used to be the best airline in Asia. No more. The seating was cramped, not China Air cramped, but certainly not on par with other competitor airlines such as ANA, and certainly no better than EVA or Cathay Pacific. Their customer service was non-existent. They canceled our connecting flight on their subsidiary airline, Scoot, booked through Singapore Air, from Phuket to Singapore on the return leg. We were notified by email just 16 days before the scheduled flight. We were informed that we had to now fly out of Bangkok to Singapore, not Phuket, and we had to re-book through Singapore Air, not Scoot, and had to telephone a customer service agent to do so. This meant a total revision of our itinerary and losing the non-refundable tickets we had already purchased for flights in Thailand. We spent a total of 4 hours on hold attempting, without success, to reach an agent. We called both the Bangkok and Singapore offices to no avail. We even had a travel agent call for us on the agent's line. She gave up after 1/2 hour on hold. We tried email. They told us they would get back to us in 7-14 days! We had gone to both the Phuket and Bangkok airport Singapore Air offices but both were closed, seemingly permanently. We gave up and flew ANA home. They answer their phones. When we returned we found that all they would refund were the taxes. Sent a letter by post to the corporate headquarters. One month later no response, not even an acknowledgment of receipt.",
                    "Be carefull. This airline offers \"flexible\" tickets which you should be easily able to change until May 2022 even for free. But when I try to change my flight back to Jakarta now they told me that my class is not anymore available and that I need to pay another almost 10 Mio IDR if I want to change the date. Its close to a scam in my opinion. So be careful here.\n\nTo be fair the flight from Jakarta to Frankfurt was really good. The staff is very attentive and try to make a good experience for you!\n\nToo bad the marketing needs to use this kind of sales tactics. \n\nI will definitively avoid them in the future.",
                    "My flight was cancelled at the airport but the cancellation didn't show up on singapore airs computer system so they didn't believe me and would not rebook me even though my travelling partner was rebooked within an hour. They wouldn't do anything and left me abandoned in a foreign city 30 hours from home with no way to travel. I had to find and pay $2500 for a flight on another airline and travel 6 hours by train to another city to catch it. 8 months on singapore still will not refund me or call to discuss, only standard email responses that aren't relevant to the matter. will never fly with them again",
                    "Our booking was cancelled by SQ without any notification and  NO refund was made by SQ. We got into the airport and denied boarding and were told by the staff that our booking has been cancelled and it was a fully booked flight, it seems that they cancelled our ticket so they can sell the ticket at the higher price. We were told that the next available flight that they can put us in is in 3 days and they were not able to provide any sort of compensation/accomodation. As a result we had to book our flight with a different airlines at the airport which cost us 2.5x of the original ticket.

                    "\"We were disappointed with our recent check-in experience at the SIA Tan Son Nhat Site. Despite showing the policy from the SIA website that clearly stated my son, a student, was entitled to a baggage allowance of 40KG, a local staff member denied our entitlement without providing any clear explanation. After a 30-minute argument, we had to pay an additional fee of USD 32 for excess baggage (my son's baggage is 29KG). Furthermore, the SIA representative who appeared was unprofessional. This experience eroded our previous admiration for the airline and we hope they take action to improve the service provided at the Tan Son Nhat Airport site.\"",
                    "Respected Faculty, I am Bincy, writing this  to file a complaint regarding a cancellation of the connection flight of Singapore airlines and the irresponsible service from Singapore airlines airport staff members at Singapore .My parents 67 yr old Dad as 63 yr old Mom travelled from Brisbane airport in Singapore airlines  SQ236 yesterday at 14.45 hrs and arrived at Singapore airport at 20.25hrs yesterday late evening. Then only they were informed that the connection flight SQ 536 which was booked and  confirmed, has got cancelled and they have to wait until next day night. This was not informed to us in any form of communication. \nAnd secondly, though my parents are very older with so many health issues, (my parents are Diabetic also, taking insulin and my parents have high blood pressure, taking medications)but they had to wait in airport in a chair without any support for 24 hours without any food especially when they are from a non English speaking background. The mental stress and physical discomforts for 24 hours they were gone through are unimaginable and we cannot express it to the full extent. They didn't get any emotional or physical support from staffs at Singapore airport.They didn't arrange any room to rest or any proper lounge and not even any food for 24 hours (my parents were not prepared to stay at airport for more than 4 hours as  we booked the tickets with least transit time at Singapore airport)\nWe had a trust in the services of Singapore airlines, and so we booked the flight for our parents with much confidence. \nWe booked the tickets through an agency Sanjo travels in India but we got the confirmation that Singapore airlines didn't inform the agency as well. So it's completely the mistake from Singapore Airlines.",

What about a similar customer service plan for flights in and out of Singapore to ensure that its Singapore passengers are treated just as fairly? Other airlines have the same 24hr cancellation policy for all flights not just only those in and out of US which is transparent and fair! ",
                    "So if your flight goes ahead with no issue then I’m sure it’s a nice flight. However if they decide to consolidate routes and or flight times you will have a nightmare. They are purposely delaying responding to customer so they can then up the price of alternative offerings when people are desperate. They are taking in excess of 2 months to refund people  whenSIA cancel flights. \n\nPart of the issue seems to be even simple changes can’t be done through the online system and resorts to you having to contact them. They response rate is literally a few hours before your flight so how can you plan hotels/visa etc around that. \n\nPlease do not use them at the moment until they invest in proper customer service.

                    "Warning - do not use Singapore Airlines.\nMy husband and daughter were due to fly on a return flight to London from Melbourne on 2nd Apr. On the 31st March the return flight was cancelled by Singapore Airlines. After many phone calls I was told that the flight had been over booked and seats were no available. We ended up last minute having to book flights with another airline.\nAs Singapore Airlines initiated the cancellation we were entitled to a refund. I rang Singapore Airlines regarding a refund and they would not speak to us and stated we had to go via the travel….even though it was actually Singapore Airlines who had taken the money from my card.\nI rang the travel agent who did their best to help. After around 20 phone calls and emails I was told I would get a refund.\nSingapore airlines attempted to refund the money but it was declined by visa as they used the wrong codes.\nI rang my travel agent to tell them and they said that the bank card details were wrong. I asked the travel agent if they could give them to Singapore airlines? They said no they can’t pass on the card details and I would have to ring Singapore airlines myself.\nI rang Singapore Airlines again. Again I got another rude agent who stated we can not discuss this with you….you need to speak to your travel agent. I tried explaining to Singapore Airlines that the refund they issued did not work as they have the card details wrong and that it bounced back to them. The agent stated that they had sent the refund and I needed to go back to the travel agent. I asked to speak to a Manager and I was told they didn’t have one available. I asked if a Manager could be emailed to call me and they said they would call. I have not received a call yet.\nI contacted my travel agent again and they said there is nothing else they can do.\nI am now in the process of taking this to the International travel ombudsman.\nSo please be warned. Do not travel with Singapore Airlines.",
                    "I always used to think that Singapore Airlines was a good airline until today. Even after submitting proof that one of their agents clearly stated that they would accept a PCR test 72 hours prior to Mt son's flight time, when my son checked in at LAX, the staff refused to let him board. \n\nThey gave him a map and told him he had to get a new PCR test which meant he had to jump on a shuttle alone and find the testing station. He was charged $199 for a PCR test with a 45 minute guarantee. This is an insane amount of money! \n\nHe then rushed back to LAX only to be told he was too late to catch the flight. They refused to issue him a boarding pass even though there was still 35 minutes to spare and he had no bags to check in. \n\nThey did offer to rebook him on snap alternative flight which meant he would have to spend 14+ hours in the airport. Then he was told that he had to get a guardian to sign a permission form because he was under 18 and traveling alone. \n\nThere was no humanity in the way staff dealt with this situation. Sll they cared about was following insane rules which ultimately made no sense since my son was only going to transit through Singapore en route to Jakarta. \n\nThe fact that he submitted a voice memo of a staff member clearly stating he could definitely transit through Singapore with a PCR test taken 72 hours pretty flight made absolutely no difference to Singapore Airlines' staff. We believed that this woman had told us the truth, but ultimately my son paid the price as did I. The incredible stress and anxiety caused by Singapore Airlines policies and unwillingness to acknowledge this staff's recording as clear proof, has not only cost me financially, but emotionally and mentally. My son had to go through an ordeal which was incredibly stressful and challenging on all levels. \n\nAfterwards, I contacted Singapore Airlines asking for compensation. Several staff promised to get back to me but they never did. 3 phone calls later, I was told by Lloyd, a supervisor based in the Philippines, that Singapore Airlines would not compensate me. There was no accountability from SIA for their egregious mistake.\n\nIt's for these reasons and more, that my family nor I will never fly on Singapore airlines again.",

(Aleady dealed with four different staff already).\n\nI think Singapore Airlines can do better than this. This is such a disappointment with the Airlines that chosen as the BEST in 2023.

The fact is that 4 ladis where standing behind the desk working on one check in and could not provid proper service so I could board my plain is unbelievable?!?!?!  35 minutes before my plane was leaving they said the boarding is closed.

After reading several similar reviews on tripadvisor,  I have just reported them to the Department of Transportation. Their website lacks functionality to rebook or cancel flights. Live chats with customer service state there are no representatives available.  I have tried submitting an online form 3 times with an automated response received but no follow up to resolve my issue within the time frame they promised. I have waited on hold for over an hour with their Los Angele office only to be disconnected at 1:20.  I have tried calling their office in the country I am visiting several times and I waited for over 30 minutes without success. I understand that with the pandemic, airline response times will be slower, but I began this process 18 days before my flight and still no success. \n\nI have never reported any business before, but this is the peak of negligence - either that or fraud.  Even if this eventually does get resolved, which I am beginning to doubt,  it has been a miserable, frustrating experience.

                    "We are had a terrible experience with Singapore Airlines. They cancelled our flight SQ494 just as we landed from flight SQ860 and couldn't get to our destination on time. We were left us stranded at the Singapore airport for a full night, with no alternative arrangements or support provided. It was incredibly frustrating and stressful, and made our travel plans much more difficult than they needed to be.\n \nTo make matters worse, they also managed to lose our airline ticket from UAE to Morocco which we had to book at our own expenses in addition to a hotel booking in Dubai. This was a serious mistake on their part, and caused us a lot of additional stress and inconvenience. We had to spend extra time and money trying to sort out the situation, which was really frustrating.\n \nOverall, I'm extremely disappointed with the service we received from Scout Airline and Singapore Airlines. It's unacceptable for an airline to cancel a flight and leave passengers stranded without any kind of support or alternative arrangements. And losing our airline ticket was a major mistake that caused a lot of unnecessary stress and hassle. I would not recommend these airlines to anyone based on my experience. And on top of that when we booked the flight we booked it through Singapore airline and no one from your company and airport wanted to help us out. \n  \nToday, we have another flight from Singapore to Dubai SQ494, now we are requesting to speak to someone from Singapore Airline and are at Transfer B desk. The least you can do is to apologize and offer an upgrade in our flight, reimburse us for the additional fees spent and the stress caused health wise.

This was after I had been given options that were not suitable for my situation, which was explained several times, with one sentence replies and then I was placed on hold again for 10-20 minutes at a time. The customer service person for some reason decided to CANCEL my full trip WITHOUT me being informed. I only found out when I went to check via \"Manage my booking\" and found that it wasn't there anymore! After this I was on the phone again, in queue for 2+ hours, then I was on hold, I was hung up on. Still, I had heard nothing from anyone that my trip had been cancelled or how they would get me to where I needed to be. In the end I was put on a flight 24 hours after my original flight, with no compensation. They even tried to make it out as a favour that I didn't have to pay for this new flight!!? \nI still had to travel further after my final destination (to a small town not offered by any code share partners or international airlines) and had to work my own way to get the flight postponed so I wouldn't miss it.\nAbsolutely no compensation has been offered for the stress, that I was put through for over 24 hours before I got my flight \"back\"! \nAbsolutely appalled by the service the call centre provided (or lack thereof).\nBe warned.",

I spoke with a polite agent who was poorly trained, who could only read off of a script but could not actually answer my questions. A few times, she went silent when I asked a question, claiming she couldn't hear me. When I asked to speak with her supervisor to see if he/she could answer my questions, the agent deflected multiple times...I had to ask 15 times to speak to a supervisor before she was willing to put me on hold to speak to a supervisor. I was not irritated the first few times I asked to speak to a supervisor because I figured she simply didn't know the answers, but I became VERY IRATE when it became clear she did not want to transfer me to a supervisor. After I became very upset, she finally proceeded to put me on hold to speak to a supervisor...where I was on hold for OVER 1.5 HOURS. The agent would speak up every 10 minutes repeating the same unhelpful information she had already told me before and saying that the supervisor was on another call. That must have been one long call with an even more irate customer than me. The agent kept asking me for a callback number, which I refused. Finally, I was connected to a supervisor after holding for over 1.5 hours who was able to address my questions and whom I also explained my extremely unsatisfactory experience up until that point. The supervisor was helpful and calm, but as I told him, what happened before I spoke to him was inexcusable that I could not on principle simply ignore.

Bartlett in the UK complaints team, who failed to review the complaint in detail, disregarding majority of the information I provided.

Transfer desk at Changi was not helpful. Computer system was down. Had to spend nearly seven hours from midnight at the airport. No offer of lounge access nor accommodation. No meal provided. No seat upgrade as compensation too. What a scam!! ",
                    "Terrible terrible airline. I boycotted them for years, but thought I’d give them a shot again. Nope, bad choice. \nI had to change one way of my return trip. Sent in an enquiry for change before my flight, which is the only way you can get in contact with a human. Without informing me first, they cancelled my return flight, and sold off my reservation to someone else. Then proceeded to tell me to rebook my original booking for an additional 2k USD, with the excuse being a flexi ticket instead of a lite ticket. Unethical and money grabbing.\nPlease note, if you had the misfortune of booking with them before reading my review, that they do not hold tickets that they quote you in an email. They will proceed to tell you that the tickets they quoted you in the morning has been sold, so your only option is to pay more money, than what you’ve already paid for a business class ticket, to beg them to give you an economy ticket.\nPlease, for the sake of your sanity, stay away from this airline. Pretty much any airline out there is a better option.",

This obviously can't happen, and really shouldn't be possible without moving the entire flight given it's one booking.\n\nTheir systems won't let me do anything about it online, so I have to call the local office. I spent 1hr 30 minutes on hold and got hung up on without SA answering the call.\n\nI'm now on hold for the second time (1 hour so far) and still no answer, and low expectations of talking to someone. \n\nThis is INSANELY bad service.

                    "We'll start with the bad, end with the good.\n\nSingapore is still feeling the repercussions of COVID, and boy does it show in the Service staff at Singapore air.  Wish I had gotten their names, but an older lady in one concierge lane was not very helpful when asked if they could help print my Pre-flight PCR document.  She pointed to a general direction, and nothing more.  She seemed occupied talking and laughing with her colleague.  Walked throughout the terminal, and could not find any remote area to print.  I visited a different service desk at a different lane, and a not-so-gentleman also rudely stated it wasn't possible to print anything and pointed to a Changi recommends area.  Well, I did not want to endanger my chances of going home so I decided to wait and if the timing got close, I would unleash my inner Karen.  After 45 minutes waiting at the Changi recommends, I was finally assisted, and rushed to the terminal.  You're lucky Singapore Air, 10 more minutes was my threshold.  Really, I get people are over this whole pandemic, but man was this experience unpleasant.\n\nFlight was pleasant.  For my recent trips to Singapore, I've deliberately booked economy flights since the likelihood of having my own row is high.  Flight staff were all exceptional, but food quality has definitely waned since pre-covid.  Completely understandable, it's still covid season, not many people traveling, why waste money on food.  Overall, flight was a pleasant experience.\n\nPrior to COVID, almost everything about this airlines was top notch.  But we've probably all experienced that COVID changes people and industry, and it's likely here to stay in the near future.  Here's to hoping for industry and people to adapt to these changes.",
                    "SQ used to be one of the best airlines. Now it is frankly an embarrassment and a mess in terms of customer service. When I first bought my ticket they double charged me thousands of dollars and it took them a week to rectify the issue — nobody would pick up the phone, and I had to email, tweet at them, and call incessantly to get them to fix it (which they eventually did, admitting they made a mistake). Now their website is completely broken and keeps giving errors when I try to manage my booking, and when I try to get through on the phone to talk to someone (since, again, they are incapable of maintaining a working website) I have been on hold for nearly an hour (see pic). I see posts on social media that people have even waiting hours to speak to someone, and all SQ ever says is that they are experiencing high call volumes. You’d imagine they’d hire more staff or do something to address the issue, but instead they seem content to become one of the poorest customer service airlines you could possible buy a ticket from. I really used to think highly of this airline and now I will avoid flying it again. It’s just not worth the absolute nightmare of trying to get in touch with them.",

I now have to book on my own expenses my transport from Marseille to Paris, a hotel in Paris and wait 13h in Singapore. I never got the chance to talk to a manger.

                    "On Sunday 5 Feb at 630pm my partner Dominic and I went to check into our flights home at the Singapore Airlines check in at Heathrow Airport. We had booked through Singapore Airlines from Canberra, Australia to London return, all flights booked through Singapore Airlines as per booking reference 560NMJ. Our flights were London to Singapore and Singapore to Brisbane via Singapore Airlines, then Brisbane to Canberra, Virgin Airlines but booked by Singapore Airlines. When checking in the lady at the Singapore Airlines check in advised nothing showed up regarding our flight from Brisbane to Canberra. She told us to go to the Singapore Airlines ticket counter so we left check in and went there. \n\nOnce arriving at the Singapore Airlines ticket counter I explained we had booked all our flights through Singapore Airlines, and that our original flight from Brisbane to Canberra (1245pm on 7 Feb) had been cancelled and we were sent an email regarding this and had accepted the changed flight departing 5pm from Brisbane, which would then mean 6 hours at Brisbane airport instead of 2 hours. First the women at the Singapore Airlines ticket counter advised they couldn't see our connecting flight from Brisbane. Then told us we had never been booked on the 5pm Virgin flight and that it was Virigin's fault because it was their flight. I had to explain to the women that it had all been booked by Singapore Airlines. Then they told us many conflicting things at once, including that the 5pm had been cancelled, then that it wasn't cancelled but the flight was full and we would have to get on the next flight at 8pm, then they said we were still on the 5pm flight, then again that we weren't on any and we would have to get the 8pm flight from Brisbane. Then they told me that what happened was we were on a 1245pm flight but that got cancelled and we were put on the 5pm one, I said to them I told you that in the first minute of talking to you. Then they brought another representative over (I think his name was Sebastian), he told us that the 5pm flight was full and they couldn't ask people to get off the flight just to put us on it and all they could do was put us on the 8pm flight. By this stage I was in tears as we already had a 13 hour flight to Singapore, 6 hours layover in Singapore, 8 hours to Brisbane, 6 hours to Brisbane then 2 hours to Canberra, and now we were being told we were going to be waiting 9 hours at Brisbane. While I was crying one of the women starting laughing/rolling her eyes/scoffing and saying how I just didn't understand, despite the fact it was me trying to explain to her Singapore Airlines had booked all our flights so it was their responsibility. They told us when we got to Singapore we could go find the Virgin counter and try ourselves to get on the 5pm flight as there was nothing they could do. Sebastian said the request for us to be put on the 5pm flight had gone through after we accepted the change but it was never confirmed. I asked why it was never confirmed and finally they had to admit it was \"a technical or human error\" by Singapore Airlines. Only then did they try again to get us on the 5pm flight while still saying we would have to get the 8pm flight. I asked how we would be compensated for Singapore Airlines not confirming the 5pm flight and therefore us having to wait 9 hours at a domestic airport, Sebastian said there was nothing I could do but \"write an email\". After much pushing back, they managed to get us on the 5pm flight and when we finally got to Brisbane and boarded it, the flight (VA1224/SQ6440) was no where near full, there was maybe 1/4 of the plane empty, despite the Singapore Airlines representatives insisting to us it was fully booked and we would have to get on the 8pm one. This was all extra upsetting as when we booked the flights we were only ever meant to stay at Brisbane for 2 hours and be on a 1245pm flight back to Canberra after already having to wait 6 hours at Singapore, I understand it's not Singapore Airlines fault the 1245pm flight got cancelled but we would never have booked that specific trip if we knew an additional 6 hours at Brisbane (let alone 9 hours) was going to occur. It was mentally and physically draining to have two 6+ hour layovers on the way home as the two long flights are already a lot to deal with, but before we even started the journey I had already been mentally drained and brought to tears by Singapore Airlines staff.\n\nWe should not have had to experience any of this, our connecting flight to Canberra should have been in the system as soon as we initially went to check in. Not only was it not in the system but we had to face the 3 Singapore Airline reps at Heathrow Airport, convince them it was Singapore Airlines responsibility as we had booked through them and then plead with them to get us on the connecting flight despite it being their responsibility, all while being laughed at and scoffed at while in tears. The push back we got from staff was shocking, how they made out like I was confused and didn't understand, how they tried to blame it all on Virgin and how they wanted us as the customers to sort it out ourselves with Virgin before I finally helped them to understand it was Singapore Airline's responsibility. It took about an hour standing at the ticket counter to get this sorted when it should never have been an issue in the first place. \n\nI have always spoken so highly of Singapore Airlines but never in my entire time travelling have I experienced such horrible treatment, and such a lack of empathy from airline staff. \n\nI wrote to them to submit a complaint about and received no reply, it’s been almost two months and multiple follow up emails and still no response or acknowledgment.\n\nDisgusting airline and will never fly with them again.",

                    "Singapore Air may have some of the best in-flight services and amenities but its customer service center and hotline is atrocious. I had booked my flight via one of their Star Alliance partner airline (Egypt Air) and was told by Singapore Airlines subsequently that the booking class in Egypt Air is ineligible for miles claims. After a few rounds of back and forth, Singapore Airlines said that they would process my miles claims if Egypt Air provided proof that it is eligible under Egypt Air's system. I obtained the necessary documents from Egypt Air and Singapore Airlines acknowledged this proof in July 2023 and agreed to reimburse my miles claims within 6-8 weeks. 4 months passed and my miles were still not credited and I reached out to Singapore Airlines again, and they told me that my Egypt Air booking class is not eligible for miles claims. It is as though all my efforts between May to July 2023 went down the drain. When I resurfaced Singapore Airlines previous emails promising that they would process those claims, they not only did not acknowledge it but merely pasted template answers each time they replied me. I tried to call their hotline but was put on hold for over an hour. I requested callbacks and was given specific timeslots for the callbacks but when the time came. My phone did not ring. When I emailed them to say that I did not receive any callbacks, Singapore Airlines merely said they tried but could not get through. If the agents truly tried, why didnt they immediately send an email to inform me of their effort? Instead, I have to initiate all the conversations. Once again, this is such a horrible experience that as a Singaporean that used to fly Singapore Airlines and/or Star Alliance whenever I travel, I would stop doing so. There is no benefit from being loyal to one airline and/or alliance these days when they treat their customers so atrociously. This is such a huge disappointment. ",

                    "These people are liars, false advertisers, and couldn’t care less about their customers. \nMy wife and I flew with Singapore Airlines for our Honeymoon. 1 week in Thailand and 1 week in Bali. We paid for business class for our flight to Thailand. The day before our flight, the airline informed us that our connecting flight (Singapore to Bangkok) had been cancelled. I called customer service immediately and they told me that they do not offer business class flights from Singapore to Bangkok and that I would need to use a different airline. I told them that this is absolutely unacceptable and after speaking with 3 different supervisors, the flight that they told me was cancelled/doesn’t exist, all of a sudden It’s not cancelled and It does exist and my wife and I were able to take that exact flight.\nFast forward to the end of our Honeymoon…we receive an email from Singapore Airlines asking us if we’d like to upgrade our flights home to Business Class as well. We carefully reviewed the email to ensure that both my wife and I would have both the flight from Bali to Singapore and the flight from Singapore back to the USA would be upgraded. Only after we PAID for the upgrade did Singapore Airlines inform us that they are only upgrading the 2 hour flight from Bali to Singapore, not the 19 hour flight from Singapore to Newark. We immediately contacted customer service yet again but we were told that there was no supervisor available and that we would receive a call back first thing in the morning. After NOT receiving a call back, my wife called YET AGAIN and after speaking with 4 different people over the course of 3 hours, we finally got a supervisor on the phone who informed us that he had corrected the error and that we would receive our business class boarding passes at the airport when we check into our flights. This was an outright lie!!!! We arrived at the airport and found out that we would not be flying business class for our 19 hour flight. After deciding that we don’t have the energy to fight this anymore, we checked into our flight and made our way to the premier lounge. Once arriving at the lounge my name was called on the intercom twice within 10 minutes to report to the customer service counter.

Managing my booking online did not allow me to buy more checked luggage, constantly gives error and tells me to buy my luggage at the airport. At the airport I had to pay penalty per kilo. Customer support does nothing to solve the problem. A scam, do not trust the cheap price.",
                    "I always have a great time flying Singapore airlines with friendly flight attendants and a great seat and that wasn’t different about this flight but it was delayed 8 hours and I missed my connecting flight which they weren’t able to put me on another Singapore airlines flight like every other time but instead put me on a budget air Asia flight for 5 hours which was a horrible experience but in Johannesburg where I was flying from they only gave us an 150rand food voucher at one specific restaurant before security and that is around 15 Singapore dollars and the food voucher wasn’t even enough for one meal and the delay went over lunch and dinner so I had to spend quite a bit of money and the virgin Atlantic lounge was closed and with the krisflyer card I had I was able to go there but since it was closed I had to pay 400rand to get access to a lounge which was mediocre at best and the other thing that I hated was that they told us to come to the gate for boarding when the plane hadn’t even landed in Johannesburg from Cape Town so I had to wait 1 hour to board when I could have just stayed in the lounge which was much more comfortable but still the actual flight was great like always but Singapore airlines should have done better with their management of the flight being delayed and there were many people who didn’t have lounge access and other things that I had so I think their time was probably much worse than mine and this is the first bad experience I’ve ever had with Singapore airlines and I think you should still fly it as it’s usually great and this is the only bad experience I’ve ever had.",
                    "My flight was terrible. To begin with my seat was broken and couldn’t be moved and the entertainment device was broken as well. My flight of nearly 8 hours was spent looking blankly into space, seated in the same position. I had severe back pain upon arrival as a result for the next couple of days. When I informed the crew, first the steward said I will be compensated with a voucher and asked me to choose what I like from the duty free catalog. When I did choose a product that would be useful for me, I was told by the air hostess that my voucher is only for $75 Singapore dollars and the rest will have to be paid by me! I informed them I don’t need their $75 voucher and that I will make a formal complaint about the plane’s defects. After my return I did make the complaint and they got back to me saying that another travel voucher of AU$200 will be issued to be used in my next flight with Singapore airlines.  But the worst part was they lied and said I was offered another seat but I had declined saying I wanted to be seated next to my husband. This was an outrageous lie. At no point did they offer me another seat. This is very concerning. You can’t trust an airline company that lies like this. I would urge everyone flying in SQ next time, to either video any exchange with the crew in situations like this or get it in writing. After discussing with my husband, I informed them that I would not be flying with them in the near future so they can give me a cash voucher. But I still haven’t heard from them. Even a budget airline would have been more comfortable than this flight. But the greatest worry is their dishonesty.",
                    "Had a horrific experience with singapore airlines customer support over the last one week. I am a Krisflyer member and redeemed my FF miles to book domestic tickets on vistara with Krisflyer. Our tickets were for 3rd Jan and as covid is increasing sharply in India, we decided to prepone our tickets and for that we have been desperately trying to contact their customer support through email, phone, Live Chat multiple times a day since the last 8 days but got no response from them.. So we had to book our return flights on another airline since we were travelling from Mumbai where Covid is increasing very rapidly. Finally got hold of their customer support through live chat today after 8 days of trying non stop during our holiday (Mind you they have still not bothered to get back to us on their own) to tell them that we have booked with another airline and asked them to cancel our tickets and return the FF Miles to our account, instead of being apologetic and helping us they are demanding a miles redeposit fee of 75USD per ticket (which is almost equal to the value of the ticket had we paid cash) that too for their own fault and said they cant do anything about it.. In the past I have travelled with SQ and has always loved their service but seems like their support and service in India is a disaster and are not interested to help. Their local office is shut and they keep you waiting on calls for 2 hours at a stretch but no ones comes on the line, they dont reply to emails and their chat support too is rarely available and that too if you are lucky enough to get to them, is least bothered to help. We contacted vistara customer support as well but got no reply from them as well. Pls avoid singapore airlines at all costs specially if you are travelling from India since you should not expect any support from them in case you need urgent help. Extremely disappointed at the disgraceful behaviour from such a large and reputed airline.",
                    "For years i have heard about the legendary service provided by singapore airlines. I have had several friends and family members use them over the years and everyone ravved about the service. I have to assume none of them ever had to deal with SA customer service.\n\nI woke up this morning to a message from SA that they rebooked me for a later flight. This later flight leaves SFO 12 hour later and increases my layover in singapore from 3 to 15 hours. This delays my arrival in the Maldives by 30 hours!!!! I understand avaition is fluid and there are many reasons they may have occurred. The upsetting part is that there are other options they could have booked me on. There is a flight that leaves SFO 4 hours later and a flight departing singapore that would give me a 5 hiur layover. Their website will not allow me to make any osrt of change despite what appears to be availability on both flighy options i would prefer. More importantly flight options that would put me in my desired destination 15 hours late rather than 30.\n\nWith this i decided to call SA customer service. I have now been on hold for 4 hours. That is right 4 hours!!! Absolutely ridiculous in any case, let alone a company known for \"great service\".  Especially painful when even my local cable company that practically embraces pior service provide their customers the option to opt out of the wait and receive a call back when operatora are available. This great company with a dedication to service doesn't have that option in 2022!!! C'mon\nWhike waiting i went to the SA website to fill out a flight change request form specifically for those needing to make a change for same day travel. After submitting the form I received an auto reply that says they will get back to me within 15 days!! And the laughs keep coming. That same auto reply says, for faster service please call customer service.\n\nSo before stepping foot on their flight, i have already decided SA has zero commitment for service. It is great they have such high standards for the flight, but that means absolutely nothing if they cannot provide any service whatsoever prior to the flight.\n\nI will never waste my money on singapore airlines again. They can go to hell",
                    "We booked a trip on Singapore airlines in premium economy.  This was for their 19 hour flight to Singapore.  It is a really long flight so I called to see if we could upgrade to Business class.  I called on two different occasions and was told by two different agents that we could upgrade for a certain dollar amount.  They upgraded us AND charged my credit card for the agreed amount.  I thought we were all set.  I then got an 'urgent' email from Singapore airlines saying that I needed to call them.  I called them and was told that on our outbound flight business class was sold out BUT Singapore airlines wanted to honor their commitment to upgrading us so they upgraded us to first class on the outbound flight and business class on the return flight.  Again, I thought we were all set.  Then I got a call from Jason Chang, employee number 00520, one of the supervisors, and I was told that the person I talked to incorrectly upgraded me and didn't charge the correct amount.  He told me I could upgrade if I wanted to pay an additional $15,000.  $15,000 was WAY higher than what I was told previously.  I explained that Singapore airlines made the mistake and they should honor the price they originally quoted.  Jason proceeded to yell at me.  I told him I didn't appreciate his tone of voice and that I wanted to speak to a supervisor.  He told me he was the supervisor and that I couldn't talk to anyone else.  Then he told me he was going to cancel my entire reservation.  For an airline that prides itself on great service, this was awful.  Not only did they not honor the original agreement but the way I was talked to by Jason was insulting and misogynistic.  We actually booked with Singapore because other friends told us they were a good airline.  If I had to do over, I would not use this airline.  The customer service we received was AWFUL!  Don't book with this airline.  They will tell you one thing and do another.  ",
                    "My first flight ever with Singapore Airlines. I chose to book my flight with this airline since everything is complicated during Covid times, Singapore Airlines is considered one of the best and offered complimentary unlimited booking changes. \nGreat! Little did I know. This has turned out to be the most painful experience of my life. Trying to reach them by phone? Impossible. You are on hold for hours constantly being reminded that they will charge you extra money if you are calling with an issue that can be resolved online. Email Request forms? No answer. Trying to change the flight date online? Doesn't work.\nGoodness me, this is supposed to be 5* airline?\nNever again\n\nI feel sincerely sorry for customer service agents, it is not their fault and they have to deal with us, annoyed customers. Nevertheless, I will never ever again book anything with this \"top level\" airline. Ryanair that sells flights for 20 euros can take care of customers much better. I strongly advise everybody to book tickets during these times with different airlines as I wouldn't wish this painful process to anybody.",
                    "I would a zero if i could but I have to put at least a one star. I would put like a negative 100 if I could. Make sure you do not travel with this airline if your passport expiration date is near. I had 13 days left until passport expiration date ends and they not supposed to sell me the flight but they did. On top they did not check that I had less days left, and let me on the flight. Terribile check in service, what are they stupid enough to not check my passport and let me fly to Germany. I went to Germany and when I arrived, the federal police came and brought me to the police station because my passport date was going to end. Because of the airline not checking and warning me I waited at the police station for about 7 or 8 hours. And the trip got canceled and I had to pay for my flight back! This is unfair they were supposed to send me back not make me pay another $850 dollars! I want my money back! If you don't want to end up canceling your trip and ending up at a police station!",
                    "The customer service at Singapore airlines is the worst I've ever experienced.  First, when you try to call them you are either disconnected or they tell you that you will be on hold for 30 hours!  If you  you ask them to save your place in line, you get a call at some random time the next day.  I've been trying to get a refund of frequent flyer miles and  money on a flight with a Star Alliance partner that I cancelled.  You have to fill out a form and send it to them rather than just cancel the flight online.  It has been over week and I have still not received a refund or had the miles redeposited.  Delta Airlines which I fly often has customer service that is a 100 times better.  Truly a terrible experience.",
                    "I can see from the reviews that Singapore airlines is not what it used to be in terms of customer service and communication they are atrocious!\nbeen trying to get a refund for over a year since March 2022.\n1st of all they changed my flight so I said i can not use that flight tried several times on the website to comminicate about it and it was so difficult and response times up to 15 days! finally I had to go to Jakarta to a Singapore airlines office to speak to someone. They acknowledged and accepted my claim but said I can just call to make a new flight resevation at a later date. During that time trying to speak to someone over the phone was impossible. Huge wait times I mean over an hour. I gave up. This year I requested a refund and I received an email saying I would get the refund within 6 weeks? this is after a year had gone by. Still waiting for the refund 6 weeks late no confirmation it had been refunded. I wrote again notifying the airline my email address had changed which I did through the Singapore airlines FF portal on the website. you have to go through a security text message to verify its you to do this. Then I get another email saying they need to verify who I am  and I need to send all the information again. OMG sooo Frustrating! Still waiting! I am wrting this review because of my frustration. I will not use this airline agian and want to warn others about my experience. This was business class flight & I am a Gold star alliance member. This is totally unacceptable as an airline and if there is a consumer complaints portal in Singapore I would love to know who to submit my complaint to about Singapore airlines.",
                    "I am writing this complain mail to voice my displeasure to the service provided to my parents from Kathmandu to Hobart. As our agent told me that my parents won’t face any difficult in their layover but it was absolutely false. I have been loyal customer to Singapore Airline for a long time now. Not just me but my whole family and relatives use Singapore Airlines for our voyage around the world. I was utterly disappointed by service given to my parents today. As my agent had told me that my wheelchair service would be provided to us throughout the journey that is till Hobart but unfortunately it was rubbish. They were given that service only in Singapore and just till the baggage collection area in Melbourne. As my mother has back issue, I was utterly devastated to know that she had to walk those long journey from international terminal to domestic one without any help from you guys. \nAlso, I was told that the luggage will directly arrive at Hobart but I was given false hope. Singapore airlines asked my parents to pickup their luggage at Melbourne and just left them stranded there only. Without the help of kind-hearten people there, they won’t be here with me right now. So just explain me why know I can believe you guys and refer you to my other friends and  family. If you guys had provided me with proper information at the beginning then I could have fix something so that my parents could have their journey without any hassle.  I pay all those money for my parent to have a wonderful service instead of taking any hassle but they faces all the hassle that I want them to avoid.\nNow about food. I was given warning about food from various people that it is worst for vegetarian people. But I did not believe them but I guess I was 10000% wrong. My parents were given a bun and team for a meal from Singapore to Melbourne. What kind of meal is that? I wonder why did I pay for all the services to Singapore Airlines if my parents was not treated in the rightful way. I was so relieved that I did not buy round-trip ticket as I was not sure about their return date. I wonder is it a marketing trick of Singapore Airlines to say one thing when we but ticket and provide us with another service in reality to boost your profit. Now how can I believe on you guys that you guys provide us with best customer experience with all the money I spend on you guys.",
                    "Hello all,\n\nThis is a honest review with our experience with Singapore airlines.\nA family of 4 from Paris to Kota Kinabalu Borneo departure date 30th June till the 25th august. \nOur flight was Paris Singapore, Singapore to kota Kinabalu and the same coming back.\n\nWhen we touched down in Singapore from paris we received a mail saying that our return ticket back from kota Kinabalu to Singapore was changed but when we looked in detailed for the timing coming back we noticed that with the new ticket times we would miss our connection flight back from Singapore to paris. \nWe replied with a mail explaining and they had to change the time of course, you think this would be a easy task you think! 2 weeks later no reply with our request to change the flight times.. So we sent another mail, We suggested that we can be flexible with the return flights and we was thinking of going to Kuala lumpar so maybe you can send us there instead of flying to Singapore, they never answered to this mail. So to make it easy we thought we would buy ourselves tickets to Kuala lumpar because we still had our return ticket from Singapore to paris. \n\nWe asked them for a refund for the flight from kota Kinabalu to Singapore as we don’t need it, again no answer. This was starting to go on and on…. Then they replied asking for our names to cancel the flight. We said right from the start many times in email writing in big capitals just that we want the money back from kota Kinabalu to Singapore thats all. This point it was different people replying to our email every time so I knew it was confusing for them, it was just a simple task from the beginning!\n\nSo then we received a email saying that they have canceled the whole trip back to paris. Crazy we never asked for this. We replied saying you have made a mistake read your emails. Next day they refunded the whole ticket price in our bank, so now we had no ticket back to paris.\nThey did say we can re-book but the price was 3 times more expensive how nice of them to ask!\n\nWait for it this is when it was pathetic. every day speaking to 3 different people on the phone emails over and over for about a week, it was a joke really bad costumer service.\nThis story was going on for 5 weeks now so when we arrived in Kuala lumpar we went direct to Singapore airlines office in the airport explaining the story for the 10th time. This is really what you want while on holiday for 2 months for a stupid mistake.\n\nSingapore airlines said they will investigate the issue. We said just book us back in for the return flight from Singapore to paris, all the flights were booked up of course, normal 10 days before departure…\nThis problem started because they never read the emails from the start, not even replying to our question from the beginning of this saga.. I said just read your email it all there clear for you to understand.\n\nWhat a surprise they found a flight back to paris on the same day!\n\nI don’t really write mail this but this was a joke from start to finish, shocking costumer service, they were completely lost.\n\nAnd what did we get from this saga you think? A big fat zero not even sorry.\n\nBorneo Malaysia, we love you but we will never fly with Singapore airlines again!\n\nYour truly James and Beatrice.\n\nRant over hope you enjoyed.",

So I called Singapore airlines to check any issues with the system. \nThe answer I got from them was - your booking is changed to \"One-way\", only existing Belgium to Singapore. And they asked me to pay 821.30 SGD additionally to buy a one-way ticket from Singapore to Milan. The customer service representative who called me to pay an additional fee was ZERO professional. He was saying that if I don't wanna pay 821.30 to re-book the flight ticket, he can offer me to cancel this flight and full refund but it was THREE hours before departure. \nWhat kind of customer service is this? In the end, I paid an additional fee and purchase a one-way ticket from Singapore to Milan. I raised a refund for my additional payment - 821.30 SGD and told them very clearly that I don't want any compensation from SQ. But my refund is rejected by SQ. \nAdditionally, I paid extra when I called them for a booking change on May 2022 which is the second payment I made for this booking.I received an apology email from the SQ duty manager about what has happened and the mistake was made by the customer service representative who changed my booking, just not sure what kind of investigation is required.",

                    "I have been a loyal customer of SIA, albeit I am not a frequent flyer as such, but every year for many years (apart from Covid) i have flown a multi itinerary trip from UK down to Australia and back again inc using their code share partners within Australia (Virgin). I lso fly business class every trip.  This year I can for sure say the non-flight customer service aspect of the company has degraded considerably. I have tried to make changes to dates only, and its been like pulling teeth! Firstly I attempted to change a MEL - PER flight with Virgin Australia as it was on an SIA ticket, They advised there was no seats available however on the Virgin website there was dozens of seats throughout the day. I ended up cancelling the flight (without any refund might I add) and having to pay $1200 for a one way trip to Perth! Now in Perth I am trying to simply change my PER-SIN flight by 5 days and my SIN - CDG flight by 6 days. THREE days ago I made the request and the outbound is due tomorrow, and STILL they cannot give me pricing! Furthermore,  do not understand why as I booked the seat 100% on SIA website that I cannot cannot make simple changes like this on their website. Instead I have to call their beyond useless call centre and each time I can be on the phone for over and hour. My request is so simple...... just a date change only! What is so difficult?? \nSadly having always been extremely loyal to SIA for this yearly trip, I will now likely use middle eastern airlines, as I have never had any issues with their customer service, and flight changes are pretty simple. My experience is with Emirates and Qatar Airlines. \nSIA need to up their game else the middle eastern giants are going to scoop up your market as they offer a far easier product. We book business not only for comfort, but also ease to make changes, as many business people need to do. SIA make it so difficult. Coupled with the fact the middle eastern carriers offer limo transfers both ends as part of the ticket too.\nThe staff on board are still amazing ,and flight is pretty good, but the whole operation is being let down by the administration side which spoils the overall experience.",

I can only say that I have nothing but good things to say about Singapore Airlines from our own experience. We spoke with one of their representatives on the phone after they rang us and she was as pleasant and helpful as anyone we have ever spoken too. She processed the return of our ticket costs after they had cancelled 2 of the flights without any fuss whatsoever. We were told that the refunds could take from 2 to 6 weeks before they would be in our bank account, 4 days later we had the full amount refunded. When all this horrible situation is sorted there will only be one airline we will use to make our trip to see the daughter and grandchildren. Good service earns its own rewards.",

However, he encountered an unfortunate situation where he was provided with only one boarding pass from Adelaide to Singapore due to \"technical issues\" as explained by the Singapore airport staff.\nThis unexpected circumstance has caused considerable distress to my father, as he perceives it as a lamentable level of service offered by the airport staff. Regrettably, no contact numbers were found online to establish communication with the Singapore airline and discuss this troubling situation.\n\nWe would appreciate it if the relevant authorities or airline representatives could address this matter professionally and provide us with a solution or explanation regarding the incident. It is important to ensure the smoothness and comfort of passengers' journeys, as such unfortunate experiences can mar the overall travel experience.\n",

Didn't have time to report the damage as had another connecting flight to Europe. Took photos and when we got to Europe put in a claim to the airlines. Despite numerous emails (each time received an automated acknowledgment) chasing after the claim and making new claims, nothing has happened. Even rang SIngapore Airlines in Singapore and spoke to customer service. Put in more applications and still nothing. \n\nIf you look at Singapore Airlines' sites in Australia and SIngapore, they are designed not be contactable.  Many of the phone numbers are out dated and ring out. They don't want your opinions. They are not interested in what you think. \n\nI had a similar issue with a third rate airline many years ago and had the same issue of no follow up after numerous emails and phone calls. I thought SIA is a first rate and premium airline. Most disappointed. It's just another airline with poor customer service.

The guy was really helpful and nothing to complain about. Though its difficult to understand their English Accent.

I wanted my refund but they said I couldn’t get it that I could rebook for another time so I did again they did not advise that Tokyo was still closed. Now that it’s getting closer for me to fly to Tokyo they are still not allowing visitors in the country. So I requested a refund and in fact they gave it to me but charged me $300 to get my refund. Please before you book with Singapore airlines make sure that the country you want to visit is allowing visitors. Singapore airlines are horrible just to call them takes about 3 hours .",

SIA never informed us of the cancellation. Later when i researched into flight history, this flight never existed. It was never meant to fly that day. They knew it but did not inform us. We did pre-departure covid19 tests and hired taxis and incurred costs. They never bothered to even help put us on the next available flight although there many available flights. Many calls (hours) to SIA office, and two visits to the SIA office (Melb airport) but still no help. All they said was SORRY it was their mistake and they ACCEPT THE MISTAKE and they will refund the money. That's all.

When you say that you want to book the ticket and want to use the credit, they book the ticket without telling you the price and ask you to wait 3 days that someone will call you after manual calculations. Then even after 4-5 days no one call you and when you call them again, they say that the last person did not forward anything so there is no seat left for that date. Then you again book the ticket with them and wait, then no one contact you. Moreover, they say we only book the ticket we can not lock the price, so when you get the call from the department fer mental calculations, you have to pay the amount whatever the ticket price the same day which is a scam, as they wait so long to call you back as they wait for the ticket price to go so high. \n\nSo far no one has contacted us, this is the third time same happening each time.

                    "My husband and I bought plane tickets to Bali for our honeymoon in May of 2021. When we bought the plane tickets, we had not yet gotten married. As soon as we legally changed our last names (we both combined names) we called social security, passport services, etc. to do the legal work. These calls included the airlines that held our tickets. We booked through orbitz and were flying through alaskan, United, and Singapore (this was due to tons of cancellations).we original Bally talked to someone from Singapore airlines and they said it would be no problem and that all we would have to do is pay $50 and submit the marriage certificate, etc. Next thing we know they tell orbitz that they actually can’t do it? Alaskan and United had no issues with changing our names for a small fee and then Singapore tells Orbitz that they can’t change our names (need though we legally got married and have all documentation). They decided to tell us that we will not get through Singapore without changing our names, but that they can’t help us with that. The only option they gave us was to cancel our flights (that they now refuse to refund us) and to buy new tickets for quadruple the price?!? My husband was given the most “high up” person from Singapore and then was given this exact information too?! After being told we can switch our names? Also, this is all two weeks before our departure when we have all of our airbnbs and excursions booked. So not only did we sit on the phone for over 24 hours, no joke! We also lost $6000 and had to buy new tickets so we can enjoy our honeymoon. I’m sorry, but what?!? You are telling your customers that they can’t legally get married and change their names, even when they are offering to pay the small fee that is clearly listed on your protocols? They are also not offering any compensations or help with covering the additional charges? We go from having extra leg room seats that we paid an additional $500 for and tickets we had prebought, so we wouldn’t have to go through this? It gets worse because then the only option they gave us was to buy $14,000 tickets a piece?! What a scam!! Orbitz couldn’t believe it and then ended up talking to them and finding out the same information and ended up finding us way cheaper tickets through a different airline. To me this is all a complete joke and with an airline who has customer service like that I would NEVER recommend them to anyone. I sure hope they decided to make it right and at least refund us our money from the first tickets. So sad that people don’t know how to treat others. We have travelled a lot and have never had any issues like this. Singapore airlines, I sure hope you never do that to anyone else.",

                    "Traveling, especially international, is so unpredictable during Covid. Anything can happen and you can't help but worry. You or your family could test positive right before a flight, Covid rules of the country you are visiting or live in could change, there could be a new Covid variant making it more dangerous to travel, and so on.  We booked a late Jan flight to Singapore in Nov to visit family for the first time in 2 years. Singapore government, although they added more restrictions and hoops to jump through, has a list that you can follow and you are able to email them and get an answer in a few days.\n\nSingapore Airlines, however, is almost impossible to contact outside of Singapore. I spent an hour and an half on hold before I was hung up on. I had to contact my sister, who lives in Singapore, to call Singapore Airlines from there. Even though they allow changes at no cost (other than price differences in fare), it is so difficult to get a hold of someone, so what's the point?\n\nOnce you get on the flight, though, everything is great again. Service is what I remember, and you do feel safer on the VTL flights, where everyone has to be vaccinated. I wish they would enforce mask wearing more though, as I saw some people take off their masks for long periods of time, and they were not eating.",

I contact them 48 hours later on the phone (1 hour waiting), and they told me to wait 2-3 weeks as they couldn't see any tickets on their system they could give me.. So I called back 3 weeks later, another 1 hr waiting. I was told they didn't have any tickets that day, so I had to change date one day and I excepted it and it will only take 4-5 days for another department to fix it and let me know. Nothing happened. So I called again, spent another 1-2 hours on a phone call, and they didn't know anything about it and gave me an option to fly via another country that will take another 5 hours (on top of 24hrs) or buy a flexible ticket that would cost 400 dollars more the day after (even that ticket was the same price when I ordered the now cancelled flight). I then had enough of this pathetic service and requested to talk to a supervisor, and they offered me refund, but it will take minimum 6 weeks... So I'm sort of locked into this. So I agreed to spend another 5 hours on the return flight and they will get it fixed and get back to me 4 days later. Didn't happened. 2 days later I am again on the phone waiting, my tickets are now on what is called 'Waitlisted' and the service team doesnt know if I will get the ticket or not. I've spent nearly 5 hours on the phone with them, NEVER EVER AGAIN.

The tickets I purchased only had an hour and 30 minutes layover time (depart at 1:10am) , but when I got to the Singapore airport, I found my flight was changed to 11 hours later (depart at 12:45pm) WITHOUT ANY PRIOR NOTICE AT ALL, NO PHONE CALLS, NO EMAILS whatsoever. This is unbelievable and the tickets were 2.9k pounds for this return flight and because if this flight change, I had to miss a day of school. When I arrived Singapore from my Macau flight, I went to the Singapore airline counter to ask about what happened to my original flight at 1:10am and all they said were they don’t know because they are not in charge of the reservations. Then they gave me a paper with a few phone numbers and told me to ring the SQ customer service Center to find out what happened. I called and ask the man what happened to my original flight and he told me my flight has been changed to the 12:45pm one because of some flight disruption problem. Then I asked them why wasn’t I informed about this and he couldn’t give me an answer. Then I asked  if the airline will do anything to compensate for my loss and he told me to try to go to the counter to ask for an upgrade or take 400 Singaporean dollar as a compensation (but my flight was 2.9k pounds), this is honestly ridiculous, but the worse part is not even here yet. Then I went to the SQ counter and told them about my flight change with no prior notice and asked for a free upgrade which I think is the very least that they can do already. BUT GUESS WHAT, they said we can’t give you an upgrade, all we can do is to put you on the 9am flight (which is still 8 hours after I’m my original flight). And I asked them again about how will your airline compensate for my loss ( that I have to now sit in the airport for 8 extra hours where everything is closed because it is between midnight time to early morning time, plus that I will have to miss a day if school because of this dumb flight change that I was not told or informed about in any way). The staff from the counter said “sorry but all you can do now is to call this number ( which is the same number I called earlier to the SQ customer service Center) and put in your complain and I want any compensations, I’ll have to speak to the number. SO THEY LITERALLY TOLD ME THE ONLY THING I CAN DO IS TO CALL THAT NUMBER AND FILE A COMPLAIN? AND THAT THERES IS NOTHING THEY WILL DO TO COMPENSATE FOR MY LOSS AT ALL. ARE YOU KIDDING ME???? So I called the number again and asked them will they do anything to compensate for my loss and this time a new lady picked up and she said she can’t do anything with the situation now as the only thing she can do is to put me on the earlier flight at 9am which I have already been put in before the call. Then I asked her if you will be able to at least provide me a free upgrade to business as I have to sit in the airport for 8 extra hours because of your airline’s problem and of course she said she can’t do that😀. Then I told her to give me her supervisors staff number and name and SHE REFUSED TO??? I believe that is my customer right to have that?? And she said she will give this case to someone in a higher position and will have them call me back to get me off the call. NO ONE CALLED BACK AT ALL. WOW AT THIS POINT, THIS AIRLINE SHOULD JUST GO BANKRUPT AND CLOSE DOWN HAVING SUCH TERRIBLE STAFF AND TREATING YOUR CUSTOMERS THIS WAY.  I have never been treated so poorly as a customer of an airline. I can’t believe this is how they treat their customers when their airline is at fault for not giving any prior notice of my flight change and change my flight without my permission at all.

However this wasn't the worst  - as my husband while away -  had a severe spinal injury which meant that I had to try and have tickets reissued not once but several times as he had two very severe relapses necessitating emergency spinal surgery and months of rehabilitation. SA Customer Service were absolutely useless. Half the time - even with my flight details in front of them - they couldn't figure out the pattern of flight re-issues and each time even though it was obviously a medical emergency and could be verified at the highest level - they gave no help with the rebooking fees or the astronomical amounts required to rebook a ticket - the difference from the original ticket price and the re-issue price. I ended up paying for my business ticket twice over in the space of 6 months. Absolute exploitation of a customer who has no other options. We will never fly with them again and when I reported my concerns with this issue I was met with a very lacklustre response and a barrage of policy documents.

First flight punctuality was horrendous they had delayed departure for almost 45 minutes the cabin crew and ground staff decided to show exception to a passenger who boarded the flight late where as did not show exception to connecting flight passengers who had to reach on time to connect the flight towards their destination. Despite the assurance provided by staff that they would ask ground staff to delay the connecting flights so we could board they did not amid so we were rebooked. Therefore, connecting flight passengers were stranded at Singapore airport missing their connection flight the lounge provided was average nothing great no reclining seats to sleep it was straight on L shaped sofas also some staff were rude. Seems like we were deliberately delayed to miss the flight and had to wait for more than 10 hours. Therefore, 19 hours journey became 29 hours. Overall, very exhausting and tiring journey. Then when we boarded the connecting flight after waiting for 10 hours the flight was good but the services were not exceptional the same desert for twice the meal nothing different and the the food provided was not what I ordered despite I was loud and clear on my option the air hostess deliberately gave me the option I did not want but I was able to switch the food option as another air hostess passed by and I told her the other air hostess mixed up my choice of food. Also there are no fruit or salads provided which every flight provides. Also when we landed at destination our luggage was delayed for an hour which takes maximum 15 minutes. Overall, considering factors like punctuality, service it’s not really that excellent it’s ok.",

Week after this booking Singapore Airlines sent an email stating that \"We regret to inform you that due to operational requirements, we are unable to provide you with the original seat and/or cabin class that you have selected\" and hence we were downgraded to Economy class. Upon calling Singapore Airlines customer care, I was told that there will be no refund for this downgrade although economy class is 3500 AUD is cheaper than Premium Economy seats. They basically left me with 2 choices:\n1. We have to travel in economy class without the refund\n2. I get the full refund and not travel.\nI requested the airlines if they can give me the premium economy seats for someother date as I am flexible with dates but all I was given was disappointment and hence I had to ask to cancel my tickets and give me the full refund.

After almost dying of thirst, economy class passengers decided to start collecting their own drinks! Absolutely no effort was made by the captain to make up for lost time in the air, even though there was a tail wind for more than two thirds of the journey! \nThis followed with a lack of communication between the Captain and the ground crew as a parking space for the aircraft had not been allocated on arrival,\ncausing further delays for passengers trying to disembark the aircraft for any further connection flights. Many passengers (about 45) had a connecting flight to bali from Singapore with the narrowest time window possible and yes of course the connection terminal was an early morning marathon as we all had to run from one side of the airport terminal  to get to the other side of a different terminal within Singapore airport. All 45 of us managed to board the connection flight but guess what…yes you guessed it…the baggage was not transferred to the flight ! Another outstanding stunt and lack of incompetence from Singapore Airlines. \nAll 45 of us who were on the connecting flight are now on the other side of the world, after a 17 hour flight, with no luggage, having to buy clothes, shoes and toiletries out of our own pockets.

None of the 45  passengers with missing luggage are any wiser as to where our bags are, as you have washed your hands of speaking to any of us and have passed the blame onto someone else as usual.

                    "@ \"Customer Service Hotline\" Team / Technical Team / Email Team and whatever other fancy name you choose to call yourselves:\n\nThis is to caution all travellers who may (unfortunately) choose to fly with Singapore Airlines: If you face any issues with your flight booking, even if it is through no fault of yours, don't bother trying to get in touch with the Singapore Airlines hotline unless you are prepared to waste your precious time \"begging\" for someone to get back to you.\n\nBe prepared that 99.99999999999% of answers you will receive are going to be scripted standard answers that you can probably fill in yourself. These scripted messages are repeated at every follow up phone call which you, as a customer, will probably have to initiate, just as I had to. Otherwise, your complaint will probably not be attended to, even as your flight draws near. \n\nThey are just going to say \"Rest Assured Sir/Madam, your complaint has been forwarded to the relevant department and we will provide you with an update once we hear from them. \" \n\nWhat's new. \n\nThis is perhaps an acceptable statement at the first phone call when you are seeking to assure the customer that something will be done. The problem is when this SAME STATEMENT is REPEATED at EACH SUBSEQUENT PHONE CALL, each of which lasts an average of 15 minutes to 40 minutes -- that is when it becomes a problem. \n\nAn assurance through a verbal statement makes no sense when no solution is in sight. \n\nIn my case, what aggravated the situation was that this whole issue arose from an error on SIA's part and not mine. I am an adult passenger and was randomly chosen by SIA's faulty website (as confirmed by the Voice Team, as they would like to call themselves), to be provided with a Child Meal Asian onboard my flight. I noticed this when I was checking my booking details online. Despite MULTIPLE follow-ups on my part re-iterating that I had NOT made this selection and that there was no option for me to make any changes on my end, the only message I received, other than the standard one above, was that SIA could not see this error on their end and even when I submitted a screenshot of the error as requested by them, nothing was done to resolve it with no progress made even after each ridiculously long phone call. \n\nIt is unbelievable that even when I was prepared to accept that this error would probably not be rectified before my flight, a request on my part to receive an email from them acknowledging that this was their error and assuring me that I would be served the standard Inflight Meal, rather than a Child Meal Asian, was met with another \"standard response\" that \"Sorry, we are the Voice Team and therefore unable to send emails to customers\". \n\nMy further request for an email to be sent to me from whatever department they wished to call themselves (I was \"today years old\" on 18 December 2022 when I learnt that they call this department the \"Email Department\"), was REJECTED because I had not made contact with the \"Email Department\" during my first correspondence with them but rather, had spoken to someone from the \"Voice Department\". \n\nI then reminded the agent who I spoke to from the \"Voice Department\" (Ms Brie) that I had asked to speak to or email someone from the \"Email Department\" during my first call to SIA, but was told at that time that the only point of contact for a customer was the \"Voice Department\". \n\nMy question then is: If SIA claims that the only way I can receive an email response from them regarding an issue that is NO FAULT OF MINE is if I had made contact with the \"Email Department\" the first time round, YET tell me, as a customer, that a customer's only point of contact is the \"Voice Department\", would they then like to suggest how I should even contact the \"Email Department\" in the first place?\n\nTo summarise, unless you are prepared to: 1) accept the error (that is no fault of yours) and resign yourself to your fate, 2) receive a verbal assurance that everything will be alright onboard the flight even though the error has not been rectified or 3) insist vehemently that you will not accept the situation because of \"internal procedures\" that you as a customer have no control over but are affected by, then SIA is not the way to fly.\n\nIt is indeed an EMBARRASSMENT of a company.",

In July 22 Singapore Airlines changed planes for this flight and downgraded me to Economy Class, a $450 USD seat, without giving me an option of upgrading seats.  They also would not issue the ticket so I could make changes.  Numerous calls to the airlines customer service and I got no help at all.  I enlisted the help of a travel agent and they got nothing but the run-around.  The day before the flight in November,  I was able to get a ticket agent to issue the ticket.

In July we discovered we could not travel in October and called 3 times to change the flight.

We expected this fare difference condition to be applied in good faith.\n\nSingapore Airlines imposed a 30% penalty for this change.\n\nI questioned the Singapore Airlines staff on this 30% penalty in two regards\n\nFirstly, we were changing to a shorter, cheaper flight, why was the cost increasing?\n* Flight Time for Singapore Paris is 13h 35m.\nFlight Time for Singapore Istanbul is 11h 0m\n* The fare for Sydney Paris is AUD7792.39-8217.25\nThe fare for Sydney Istanbul is AUD 6342.59 at the time we proposed the change to the booking.\n\nSecondly, part of this change is that an airfare Singapore Paris on 26 Aug is now made available for sale by Singapore. The price of this fare is higher than the Istanbul fare which would be taken off the market by our change. So as well as charging an extra 30% for the outward bound leg of our journey, Singapore profit further by the higher sale price of that Paris fare. Singapore may well say that they might not sell this fare. Perhaps, but they also may not sell the Istanbul fare.\n\nDespite interactions with many many Singapore Airlines staff, not one person ever answered the issues raised, or in any way \"owned the problem\"\n\nTo make matters worse the Singapore Airlines representative proudly told me there was \"no penalty\" for the change in booking. In such case why the 30% charge for changing to a cheaper flight ?\n\nSo while I understand “revenue maximisation models” I also understand concepts of acting in good faith with customers. How does this latter concept factor in their penalty ? Singapore Airlines talks with pride about the experience it provides to people who fly with them. The process we are going through now is part of that experience. All we were looking for is that people act in good faith and with fairness.\n\nThese practices should really be reviewed by Australia's consumer protection authorities. The statement \"Booking change fee Complimentary (a fare difference may apply)\" is clearly grossly misleading. That should be our next step.",

                    "I booked a round-trip ticket on Singapore Airlines. The company touted customers' ability to change their flights for free, even being able to change a flight for free and having one free change after September 30, which would allow them to delay their flight well into 2022. I was able to easily change the flight until mid-September. After that point, I wasn't allowed to change it online and needed to call in which required over 1 hour of waiting. In September I could have changed my return flight to far into the future. In fact, the return leg of my flight was 2 months and 1 day after the initial flight. When I called in to push my flight date back, the customer service agent said I must upgrade my flight to rebook and that there was a minimum required stay of 2 months, meaning I couldn't have the return leg of the flight more than two months after the initial one. First of all, my return flight was already more than 2 months later and before they restricted online flight changes, I could have changed my flight to much later dates. The agent also told me the flight change would cost over 900 USD, more than the original round-trip ticket. I requested to speak to a manager. She denied my request and said she would talk to her team. After 30 minutes of being on hold, she said I could book my flight a maximum of one month past the current return date. This was not part of the agreement when I originally booked the flight. Now, however, I didn't need to upgrade the flight for some reason, but the change would cost 490 USD. Booking a one-way ticket at that time cost 497 USD. The agent explained that the difference was in the price of the flight. Nothing she said made sense. I am about as likely to trust Singapore Airlines again as I am to fly with them.",

                    "I recently booked a very expensive seat with SQ and deliberately paid extra as I needed the flexibility to change my booking if needed. With this fare type they also promise a refund in the event of a cancellation. As it turned out I indeed had to cancel my flight a week before the departure date. In fact I was in hospital on the night I was supposed to fly out. I have been going back and forth with them for weeks and the latest is that it could take “six working weeks” for them to refund me as “per bank practices!” That means 9 weeks since I requested the refund for them to pay back MY money. They are a disgrace and I will never use them again. \nI am escalating the matter needless to say.",

I had also called their customer service last week and had to wait 1 hour until someone picked up. The person that picked up was not helpful at all, putting me on hold for at least another 20 minutes in total. In the end my request to refund the ticket into credits or money or at least rebook the ticket in the same class for another date was not fullfilled.

Despite me being in daily telephone contact with the call centre and reassurances my case had been 'escalated' and my laptop would be delivered it never arrived. I had also sent a number of e-mails to them and had no replies from them until two weeks later where I was advised to contact Lost and Found at Heathrow airport.

It was staffed by a lovely group of people who were pro-active, efficient and courteous. As a frequent flyer in First and Business Class since 2002, I was recognised and given attention every time I had to contact them to make/modify a booking.\nNow, sadly, that office is closed. Instead, there is a \"contact-centre\" with people whose purpose is apparently to make life EXTREMELY difficult for their loyal customers. Unfortunately, if you wish to make a mixed-class redemption booking, you have no choice other than to \"contact\" this centre. On doing so, you are given false or misleading information; and have to deal with stubborn non-cooperation.\nThis is SHAMEFUL coming from an airline that has won several awards.\nI will not be flying with them again.",

When I raised the issue to the Singapore airlines customer service they would say it is actually $440, I  argued about their policy with them and told them I still have cancelled ticket with cancelling fee written on it. Then the customer service apologise for the inconvenience and took my details. Now here is the funny part they told me they would call me but guess what ? got no calls or email regarding the issue. At this point I give up. I know it's only $50 but it's about the honesty of the company. They say something and do another thing. What a bunch of bull people running the business.

I tried talking to the Supervisor but they never came on line.\n\nI am very very disappointed with Singapore airlines. I had to call my travel agent and they had to cancel this trip and book a new.

Sure enough, two of the six flights were affected by changes which resulted in longer layovers - this is what I am prepared to accept.

I didn’t want compensation just a return of the money I had spent on a ticket to get me to Brisbane. Singapore Airlines have totally refuse to pay and have said they will only re emburse me £18 which is an insult. I’ve sent numerous e-mails but to no avail. They are a disgrace.

                    "I have been a loyal customer and frequent flyer of SIA for more than 15 years. I always thought SIA as the best airline with the best customer services, until I have the pleasure of dealing with a cancellation refund that I have been waiting for, for almost 12 weeks now.\nThe ordeal started on 3 Nov 2022, when I rang SIA seeking cancellation and refund of air ticket for my partner's trip (return trip Sydney to Singapore). He had to forgo the trip due to an unforeseen event. At the time, MIA who attended to my request directed me to fill in an online request form for the refund to be processed. The standard waiting period is around 6 week she said. I received an email notification from SIA noting receipt of my request.\nHaving patiently waiting for more than 2 months, I rang SIA today (25 Jan 2023) to find out status of the outstanding refund. MEDICINE who attended to my call advised that she could see the request form, but not sure why it was not actioned for refund. Nevertheless, she was re-submitting the refund request on my behalf again.\nI requested for a timeline of when I can expect the refund this time. The sum is more than AUD$3K and I am not going to sit around and wait for another indefinite time.\nMEDICINE could only give me the standard answer along the line of \"it will be done but we do not know when.\". So I asked to speak to her supervisor or manager, someone who can and has the authorisation to give me more concrete answer.\nThis request told 15 mins of listening to some yoga-zen-type-of music, so by the time the supervisor came to the line, I have already been on the phone for more than 30 mins.\nTo my frustration, the supervisor TOKYO asked me to repeat the reason for the ticket cancellation. Seriously? Instead of answering a simple question I have, I am being asked to repeat myself? The reason was already addressed twice - once on 3 Nov 22 and another round with MEDICINE.\nWhere is the problem? Lacking a reason to refund my air ticket? If so, there is no communication to advise me of such! \nOr the lack of explanation why my submitted form has not been actioned? Well, it has happened and I am prepared to let it be. BUT I want and need to know when the refund can be actioned this time. Why is it so hard to get an answer?\nMind you, AUD$3k+ is sufficient to collect a small interest if it is in the bank for 3 months. Is SIA going to pay me 3 months interest when the money is eventually refunded? Or a thank you note for helping SIA accumulate interest in their account? As it seems there are many similar complaints out there.\nI am not sure I will receive a call to update me of the refund status in the next 24 hours. I am not sure if anyone at SIA monitors the customer satisfaction scores of their back-end services. But I can tell you, I do not know how to rate the other questions here. Will I recommend this airline? Yes, BUT ONLY if you do not have to cancel, or make any changes to your flight, becuase SIA seems to have excellent front line services but appalling back-end services.",

He told me to book the cheaper fare online (while he was on the phone) and he would refund me my previous ticket.  After I book my new ticket, he told me to pay the cancellation fee of 300usd and that he wasn't able to cancel the ticket for me.\n\nAt the end, he made me pay for 2 exact same tickets and an additional 300usd for the cancellation charges.

The first leg of my flight is YVR airport- HKG airport by AC and the 2nd leg of the flight is HKG-SIN by SQ. After queuing for 1.5 hours at Vancouver airport, I was informed by AC staff that I am not allowed to fly as they are unable to print out the flight tickets for SQ and Hong Kong’s airport transit criteria is to have both printed boarding passes. They brushed me off at the counter and told me bluntly to go purchase a new ticket that does not involve SQ or go fly with another airline. I repurchased the same route on AC for YVR-HKG right at the airport but with a 20 hours layover in Hong Kong flying my second leg with Cathay Pacific. For some bizarre reason, Star “Alliance” partners do not have the rights to issue tickets for their alliances but AC can issue a ticket for Cathay. \n\nTo avoid a 20h layover, I contacted SQ and was advised to get another ticket for my second leg, the flight I was supposed to be on. To my horror in Hong Kong, not only did SQ not allow me to board with the new ticket that I repurchased under their advice, I was also made aware that there is a White male business class passenger flying the same original route that I was refused boarding with AC7 and SQ883. Would AC and SQ care to explain what’s with the prejudice? Is it due to racism or a flight class discrimination? Maybe sexism? \n\nAs I thought my nightmare will be over, I looked at my baggage tag sticker and it reads AC7 and SQ883 not Cathay. After spending over 3 hours with the AC staff, he is still unable to locate it in Hong Kong and we had to file a missing baggage report. I left Hong Kong finally after 20 hours without knowing the location of my bag and if it went on the same Cathay flight as me. \n\nAfter the torturous 38 hours journey, I was informed in Singapore that my bag is still in Vancouver and they have no confirmation when it will be arriving. Just when I thought it couldn’t get worse, they told me that there is no AC staff in Singapore and no one will deliver my bag to me while I am serving my quarantine, I had to send someone to the airport to pick it up for me. No word of concern if I have everything I need with me, no apologies nothing just AC faulting me again for their mistakes. \n\nMy advice, if you are not a white male flying business/first class, do NOT travel with Air Canada and Singapore Airlines. \n\nUtterly disgusted.",

I was up most of the night anxiously waiting for the message of my next flight in case I missed it I was on an online chat with someone who said “I will help now” but then would just end the chat. \n\nI decided to head to the airport as it was now around 9 am with no contact by anyone and I had a wedding to make on Friday the 5th. \n\nI arrived at the airport and NO ONE cared and didn’t even want to give me the time of day. Singapore Air said it was Lufthansa’s fault and Lufthansa said it was Singapore Air’s fault the walk time to each desk was around 15-20 mins and I was back and forth with everyone sending me to random desks for 3 hours!!!I was told there were no flights for 3-4 days and there was nothing I can do and it was my responsibility to pay for the time I’d need to spend in Germany, I’m a solo female aged 25 and was even refused to receive my case so had no clothes to wear. \n\nAt this point, I was scared and so upset that no one wanted to help me and that I was going to miss my best friend's wedding. \n\nI checked Skyscanner and there were flights leaving that day, at this point, I had enough and went to the business class desk and demanded that I be put on this next flight that I repeatedly lied to that had no space. After some tears, I was finally helped by someone and was very easily put on the flight. \n\nObviously, the extra leg room seats were taken which was understandable so I will need to receive a refund for this. \n\nI’m so upset by the whole process and sadly won’t be using Singapore Air again due to the way I was spoken to and made to feel like no one cared, solo girl traveling can be scary this really didn't help.",

It took hours of multiple  dialing in and waiting. The service centers in Europe and Australia are not reachable for hours. Very long holding patterns in Europe. The dial in options are limited. You need to very patient.\nUnfortunately, the service representatives are way over their heads. They are not able to change anything without the consent of their bosses.

A return of pay was not offered.\n\nOn board service - average\nThe post C19 rules have been dropped. Boarding is as you please. Very chaotic at times. Boarding takes forever.\nNone of our 4 flights from Europe to Australia and back was on time – none!\nFood quality has suffered tremendously. The taste, the texture and the temperature of food is average – best case.\nThe A350 is a very loud and poorly climatized plane. Cabin temps were extremely low even though multiple passengers were complaining. The on-board entertainment system had to be rebooted.

I have asked for a compensation, as this has affected my trip and I wouldn’t have purchased these flight tickets if I knew that I would have to wait 9 hours for the connecting flight, the representative said I could refund all the tickets and buy a new one just few days before I depart from london.

On each of these occasions i spent 2 to 3 hours trying to undertake and confirm some simple changes to my flights. On each occasion the operators were not able to process and confirm the requested changes.\n\nI also (on numerous occasions) emailed Singapore Airlines with the details of the required changes and the details of the telephones conversations.\n\nFrom all of my attempts to communicate with Singapore Airlines i did not receive a single communication or confirmation in response. Incredibly there was no audit trail or evidence of any of my conversations with them.\n\nI checked my itinerary through the Singapore Airlines website about 3 weeks before i was due to leave to find that my return flight to NZ had been completely cancelled. I then decided to cancel the flights, but was incredulous when i found that i would have to pay the flight cancellation fee - this despite the debacle that had occurred up to this point. \n\nIn the end i had to purchase a last minute, expensive flight with an alternative airline - which was a very simple and straightforward process.\n\nIn summary, i spent and wasted significant amounts of time dealing with Singapore Airlines, had to pay a cancellation fee and incurred significant additional cost as a result of Singapore Airlines ineptitude. I have flown with Singapore Airlines previously and have found their aircraft and services to be good, but i am disgusted with how i have been treated on this occasion. On this basis i would recommend other airlines (such as Emirates) in preference to Singapore Airlines.",

SA customer service wanted to charge me an additional $736.00 USD to not take a sold-out flight that they could have certainly could have re-sold my seats on.

I didn't even mind paying a fee for that, I just didn't want to waste my whole ticket ! \n\n2- I have tried to contact them since more a month (so it was 3 months before my departure! ) and still don't have any answer from them . \n\n3- SUMMARY: \nThe way Singapore Airlines will do anything to take your money is by promising you options you can't actually access, then making you feel like ''giving up'' so they keep all the money and sell another ticket instead of postponing (as promised) . \n\nThis airline is a scam.

Would not accept these for my subsequent booking, instead advised I would have to pay for the new flight and I would have this money reimbursed. 3 months later still nothing. So I paid  for a second flight, no problem, booked directly with Singapore, my original ticket had 30kg baggage, which I need as I travel with sports equipment, they sell me a ticket which is now only 25 kg! I cannot fit my gear in that allowance. Speak with Singapore representatives 4 times, all promising to sort my problem, guarantee that they will be back to me within 24-48 hours, not one response. Today again I speak with a representative, again, they are going to create a file. I have no confidence they will, or that they will return with an answer. Singapore Airlines as a national carrier your service has been appalling, its embaressing, and totally unacceptable. I fly in one week, and have been trying to sort this for two months, will someone actually respond? Another 24 hours since I posted this and nothing from Singapore Airlines, are they totally incompetent! One week until I fly, is this appalling service going to continue?",
                    "Singapore Airlines feedback channel is one of the worst in the industry. Not only do they ignore customer feedback and request all the time, they also reply in a rude and unapologetic manner when eventually they do.\n\nI have no idea where SQ hires all these customer service personnel from? Those that I have interacted with are ethnic Indians, so can i presume they are outsourced to India? \n\nFor 2 incidents, I have feedback to SQ due to poor flying experiences. Both times, they never replied me, even after I sent 3-4 reminders. \n\nFor the second incident, which was in January this year. I boarded a flight from Melbourne to Singapore. It was a very turbulent flight. And the kids on the flight were crying. But the air stewardess did nothing to solve the discomfort of these kids. \n\nIn the meantime, the kid has urinated all over the seat and the urine has dripped into my bag which was stored under the seat. \n\nI complained through the feedback line. And the airline did not respond after even 3 weeks. I wrote 2 reminders, and only in the second reminder, when I threatened to escalate the complain did they reply.\n\nIn their reply, it was curt and abrupt. It was not apologetic, nor did it show that they cared very much. \n\nThey said that since it was caused by another passenger, it was no responsibility of the airline. And hence they could not do anything about it. \n\nThey did not attempt to help at all. \n\nI also, in my original complain, and in the 2 reminders, asked them to issue a Damage report, so I can go ahead to claim from my insurance. I had shown the leading stewardess during the flight what is the extent of the damage. And so I wanted a damage report. \n\nThis was conveniently forgotten in the reply. I wrote a 3rd reminder, and they have yet to respond to it. \n\nThis is the poor quality of the customer service that you get from Singapore Airlines. They dont really care about you, yet they charge astranomical prices for your airfares. While year by year, they are dropping from (once) the top airline in the world, now not even in the top 10.\n\nI think there is something seriously wrong with the airline. \n\nThe CEO is engrossed in cutting corners, from serving food in cardboard boxes to lowering the service standards of their steward crew, claiming it is COVID. At the rate this is going, Singapore Airlines will soon join the league of cheap but lousy local airlines that is common in the US. It will be a shadow of what it used to be.",

                    "I am disappointed that Singapore Airlines is price gouging and taking advantage of people who need to rebook flight due to covid. I had an oringinal booking from Osaka to Singapore for Dec 23, 2021. I could not travel due to covid and I wanted to push my flight back one year. Singapore Air would not let me do this so I pushed it back to April of 2022 with the intention of pushing that one back to Dec 23, 2022 when I intend to fly. I am now trying to  rebook from April to December 2022 and my travel agency (Expedia) told me it will cost over $2000 per ticket to rebook!!! This is outrageous!!! The fares online for that date are $679 USD per person. I paid $569 USD for my original ticket and $130 USD to rebook to April the first time for a total of $699 per ticket. So although the website says its $679 to purchase a ticket in December of 2022, I am being told its the amount I have already paid plus over $2000! This is taking advantage of your customers. I have never flown with Singapore Air and I was excited to experience and see what was behind all the good reviews online. However, thus far, the experience has been much worse than any other airline we have booked through for this trip. Why can't you give me the price that someone booking online would get? This is not fair.",
                    "This review is not about a flight experience but the awful experience we had with Singapore Airlines trying to connect with a live agent and to get someone to address the cancel and refund process that we wanted done within 24 hours of our booking.  Their webpage has numbers that don't exist, call centers are staffed by rude, unprofessional people that hang up on you after giving you another number that doesn't exist.  We spent 6 hours trying to sort the simple issue out.  We finally found a number after an extensive online search and by just randomly hitting numbers on the number pad when it went into auto mode, we connected with an individual.  Mercifully, Joni was the exception and she handled the refund issue in 15 minutes.  We just lost a half day trying to sort something that was a mere 15 minutes ..if that and to get an email stating that our refund would be made available in 4-6 business weeks.  It doesn't take that long for SA to collect monies from us but, boy, the completely asinine process in place to amend an issue is unbelievable for an institution that has been in place for as many years as SA has been.",

                    "Singapore airlines single handily made our honeymoon an absolute nightmare. \nWe were heading to Thailand and Bali for our 2 week honeymoon. THE DAY OF our flight out to Thailand, they cancelled our connecting flight from Singapore to Bangkok (after we had upgraded our flights from premium economy to Business) and we spent THREE HOURS on the phone until they were able to finally fix it and find us a connecting flight (which they told us didn’t exist, but magically it appeared after fighting with the customer service rep). \n\nThen, on our returning flight, we had received an email about upgrading our flight again to business class and the email clearly specified that we would be upgrading both legs of our flight. After paying to upgrade, only one leg of our flight was upgraded. Mind you, it was the 2 hour flight and not the 18hr flight back to NY. Upon realizing only one leg was upgraded, we immediately called customer service to have the issue fixed. Because it was late at night, the woman on the phone promised me she would have a supervisor contact me the next day. After not receiving a call back, I called back and spent another 2 hours on the phone and after talking to FOUR people was told that they would be able to fix the issue at the ticket counter once we checked in for our boarding pass. \n\nNot only was that not true, but then I had to speak with multiple people at the counter as well as call customer service back AGAIN only to be told they could do nothing and the “matter would be escalated”. \n\nNot only do they false advertise, but they outright lie to customers just to get them off the phone and their customer service could care less about their actual clients. \nWe will NEVER be flying with Singapore airlines again and will be filing a report with the better business bureau as well as consumer affairs. Terrible business practice.",

I called Singapore Airlines and wrote in to ask for the US$200 cancellation fee to be waived and refunded.\n\nThe experience was a nightmare and the response was shocking to a long time customer.  It took a long time to get through the hotline.  My request for refund was rejected with no good reason provided. \n\nWhat is the motivation behind the rejection?\n- why would the airline want to squeeze a customer for a few extra dollars after being paid a few thousand US$ more by a customer to buy a more expensive service?  Is this even reasonable?  I like to invite any customer to comment on this point \n- or does Singapire Airline not care about the customers being happy and doing what’s right for making a few extra dollars?",

As long as you never have to deal with the online chat customer service. several employees that I dealt with are so blunt, rude and arrogant to talk to, a real shame in the customer area, not a reflection on the rest of business that's for sure. but sad to have to deal with them if you have to. I am sure not all but certainly 2 I have dealt with, WOW. compared to the rest of the amazing staff we have experienced every time on Singapore Airlines. The company needs to look at removing the several poor customer service agents that service their chat lines to ensure they remain the high in their customer service.",

The website is slow. The customer service representatives do not respond to emails at all. The people on the chatbot are not very useful. With my latest trip, I just found out that after confirming my seat, that was cancelled and I now have to book another seat that is in a worse location. Yet the airline can't offer any satisfactory explanation. For an airline that is charging a serious premium over its peers, this is unacceptable. Will not be flying with Singapore Airlines again in the foreseeable future.",

I’m 6 feet tall so I could cope with a five-hour flight, but I wouldn’t like to contemplate a long-haul flight in these seats.\n\nOne slight annoyance: - when I booked these flights back in December, I had some problems using our Krisflyer points and so contacted Singapore Airlines customer services who completed the booking for me.  Subsequently I was charged 68 SGD – around £41 – which was initially explained as a credit card fee.  Having challenged this, the charge was eventually explained as a service fee applied when using customer services to make a booking.  My complaint – that charges like this need to be explained before the customer commits and not afterwards is still awaiting a formal response from Singapore Airlines some five months later.  Customer service standards with this airline are certainly falling so be aware of this practice before you make a booking through their contact centre.",

So I went to the airport but was not allowed to board my flight and when I called the airline from the airport again they said I don’t need a visa, passed the phone on to the lady at the check in and she refused to let me board the flight. To which the SIA rep (Lou) said it’s not their fault that their code share airline is not allowing me to board the flight. After mentioning that it was their rep who confirmed with me I can board the flight and that’s why I was already there at the airport. I asked them about the next available flight and they asked me to pay to change the flight, even after mentioning that I had received confirmation from their airline I was okay to board the flight and their staff has given me wrong information. The new rep Lou was very unhelpful and kept on putting me on hold after anything I asked her, I spent 100$ of phone credit just to try and change my flight or get a refund. I myself work in Customer Service and if my customers were in distress I would find different solutions to help them out but instead Lou was absolutely clueless about what she was saying or doing, kept putting me on hold without asking me if it was okay to keep me on hold and I had to ask her again and again about how could they help my situation! Now I’m just left with disappointment in this airline and hope they give me my refund and are more considerate towards their customers!

I boarded in Coimbatore, India via Scoot airlines( operated by Singapore airlines). The flight was delayed by 2 hrs. They kept saying delayed by 30 mins and kept moving the time. There was no reason given. Food was not that great too. Staffs were mostly friendly except one. There was no ice cream with kids meal and it came only with adult. She gave my husband and me, we asked one more for our 9 year old daughter and she refused saying it was not part of the kids meal. Anyways, even though flight was delayed, i was hoping they would make arrangements with out flight to Seattle. However, they just made us run, literally... We were at the terminal finally and their systems did not recognize the boarding pass we had and they made us wait further for validating us manually. It was 12 hrs flight to Seattle. Seats were so close and narrow like a bus seat. Not comfortable at all. When we landed we were told that our checkin bags did not arrive and it would take 4  more days to arrive but we would be compensated. As I was tracking I only got email that they were trying to locate my check-in bags without exactly updating the actual status. Then the bags arrived 4 days later. I wanted to reach out to customer support for compensation they promised at the airport. There is no customer care number you can reach for these kinds of questions. There are onlu forms and emails to send. I am waiting for response for the last 10 days. And there is none yet. I will not be flying with them again.",

Having to find a place to get the right kind of test in a city that we are unfamiliar with was pretty tough, and our documents were all over the place, too. We wouldn’t have made it on time, if not for Neda, our lovely agent from Singapore Airlines, who kept the check-in desk open for us ~25 minutes past the closing time, doing her best to manage our printing and sorting. We ran into Neda again at the gate, which she kept open for us another ~20 minutes longer than it was supposed to be, because our COVID test hadn’t arrived on time, simultaneously coordinating expectations with the rest of the staff on the radio, hotspotting us from her phone, and apologising that we had to go through all that.

She advised me she had to separate my booking from the others to allow me to change my flight. said to login and now change it. Hung up to follow her instructions and the flight had 2 return flights (1  x that she hadn’t asked me the time in the day i wanted to fly for the new date and the other the old flight) and the button to change my flight was greyed out. \nCalled again and customer service said they could not change my flight because i had already used to complementary booking service. I explained she that wasn’t the case because previous customer service said they split my booking from the other. She then said it was going to cost $750 to change the time of the flight on that day.  I said ill leave it at the selected time. \n3 weeks later went in to book my seat and meal and noticed the flight on the 19 had disappeared and reverted back to the 17th. Called customer service again and she said there would be now $1200 fee to change the flight from 17th to 19th. Said why? i had it confirmed flight on the prior booking? she said it was confirmed but not ticketed and lapsed because i hadn’t paid $580. Said no one had informed me that i needed to pay $580 to book the flight, and i had a complementary booking so shouldn’t have needed to pay a change fee. She said its now changed the economy seat type and refused to allow me to book the ticket that was originally booked for me even though the poor communication and booking process was a Singapore Airlines issue. \nHave asked to speak to the Manager, she obviously didn’t me to speak to the manager because then instead of asking to book in a time to call, as she did before, she informed me to be available for 38 hours for a call.

                    "Our flight was delayed and they made us wait in the plane for 5 hours. There was a time for about 30 mins to 1 hour wherein there was no light and air conditioner inside the plane. They made us embark to the plane and gave us food stamps. The thing is, we had an another flight from another airline and we made sure to have a 6 hours layover when we arrived to the final destination.  But since we were delayed we didn’t get to take the plane. We asked about our situation while we were at our stopover if we ever missed our flight because of the delay they told us that when we get there (the final destination) if we ever have to take the next plane the next day they will give us a full accommodation. But, when we got to the final destination they denied us and told us that they can’t do anything about it and that we have to pay for our own and ask the other airline. Luckily, the other airline rebooked us for the latest flight that we could get which is tomorrow noon. I just feel really disappointed of how things went.",
                    "I am very annoyed. I booked my flights and never received the eticket, despite the money being taken out of my account immediately.

                    "***AVOID AT ALL COSTS***\n\nAn absolute scam of an airline company, I wanted to change my flight ticket on 20th of April and was rushed to send a confirmation for a flight change before 21st of April which involved a payment of 300 SGD which I agreed to. Upon calling back a few days later after checking that my flight has not been booked over the website, the agent over the phone tried to salvage the situation by LYING to me insisting that my original flight change booking flight was cancelled and instead, I now would have to pay SGD 1700 to rebook the flight change. There was no such cancellation of flights as the flight number of the \"cancelled\" flight was the exact same flight as the one that he proposed. I tried calling on multiple occasions and even though Singapore Airlines admitted their fault for SCREWING UP my booking and LYING to me, they would not change my flight at the original price that was agreed upon. As a result, I had to miss my other travel plans to London. Kudos to you idiots at Singapore Airlines for this.\n\nMy main issues are these:\n\n1) After rushing me to confirm the flight changes before 21st of April, which I did on 20th of April, why was the flight not booked at the original agreed price of SGD 300. Is it a lack of competence that your staff can't operate a computer? The agent responsible for this is Shifana Khan, Customer Service Executive at Singapore Airlines.\n\n2) When I called to enquire about the unconfirmed flight change, why did your agent lie to me and say that the original flight that I was supposed to change to was cancelled, and try to scam me for SGD 1700? IS IT ETHICAL TO LIE? Unfortunately I do not have the name of this agent as I was too shocked over the phone when I heard this.\n\nIn summary, if you want to get overcharged for non existent customer service and want your travel plans to go up into flames, use Singapore Airlines. \n\nAnd also do check out their Facebook page to see a log of unhappy customers who are facing/ faced similar issues as me, who had their travel experience spoilt because of their incompetency.",

                    "Singapore airlines changed our flight at the beginning of our honeymoon trip to the same itinerary exactly one day later, which caused our quarantine hotel reservation to be invalid. Our trip to Indonesia requires a strict quarantine procedure, and a multi-night stay in a non-refundable quarantine hotel. The new itinerary prevents us from being able to begin our stay at the quarantine hotel on the correct day, and invalidates our entire prepaid, non-refundable package.\n\nI have now been on the phone a total of 4 hours and 45 minutes trying to resolve this situation, the first 3 hours of which I was on hold, and the representative has given me two options. I can either get a refund and rebook a much more expensive flight, or pay an additional $400 dollars per person to be moved to our original flight (the same original itinerary). \n\nA more appropriate and fair resolution would have been to waive the additional fee and restore our original itinerary, which is still available.\n\nThis is clearly a predatory business practice designed to extract more money out of customers who fly economy, and is extremely dishonest.

I went up to the customer service desks and someone told me they closed the gate an hour before the flight took off and they have giving my seat to another. I asked to speak with their manager and she tried to lie to me. to a point I was very upset because I only had a backpack and psa. She refused to give me a ticket and she said they closed the gate 90 minutes before took off. I asked her I have about an hour and 20 minutes before took off. Security was called on me and she marked me as a no show. 3 months later I was still fighting with EDreams due to this no show. I called Singapore and explained the situation and file complained. Due to this flight I had to canceled other flights and booking. They promised me a refund and told me to wait 3 months for the process and now 6 months later they refused me to refund again and I had to start from scratch. They said customer service marked me as a no show. I would like to say I arrived 1 hour and 20 minutes before took off even with the delay from from first flight . My seat was giving to someone else which at first they tried to lie about it at JFK airport. I lost more than $1000 dollars which Edream and sigapore is refusing because they were marking people as no show . That’s stealing",

                    "Having flown Singapore Airlines before and experienced amazing service, was really pleased to find a flight for my dates which was reasonably priced.  A little concerned that the initial leg of the journey was with their budget partner Scoot, but heard some good reports about them so thought it would all be good.\n\nFirstly, was unable to check in online with Scoot or contact anyone to do this prior to flying, which meant no option to book a meal on the plane.  Our flight also left almost an hour and a half late, meaning the 1 hour 50 transfer at Singapore was going to be tight.\n\nWe arrived at Singapore and were immediately told to run and catch the tram as our connecting flight was the opposite end of the airport.  We all made the flight and were really relieved.\n\nThe Singapore to London flight was OK, but very limited offer of food or snacks as was the case pre-pandemic.  Hostesses often seemed a little annoyed to have to deal with customers too, so I didn’t call for them at all during my flight.\n\nOn arriving in Heathrow, we were told that our luggage had not made the connecting flight and to report to the help desk.  They told us at the help desk that all our luggage would be arriving on the 3:40 flight and would be transferred to our UK addresses by the end of the next day, the following day at a last resort.  \n\nNow nearly 3 days in the country, no luggage and cant get anyone to answer any queries about when it’s going to arrive.  Keep being fobbed off on the telephone helpline with no exact information being given and no replies to emails. Only in the country for 11 days, so looks like I’m going to have very little time with my own items!!!\n\nNeedless to say, I will seriously consider whether I fly with Singapore again in future as the after service care is non-existent.",
                    "Singapore Airlines had sub-contracted this Fydubai ticket from Tehran to Dubai. MyTrip (the booking agent) have said that they need to provide the refund, but they're accepting no responsibility for this: \n- I went to check in at the FlyDubai desk, at Tehran International Airport, on Thursday 18th November, and the representative refused to process it because he said that I didn't have a transit visa for DBX. When I checked the DBX website, the site confirmed that I didn't need a transit visa. Also, I traveled via DBX 6 months ago and no transit visa was needed. When I explained this, he changed his mind and said that he wanted to see a transit visa for SIN instead. I googled it and showed him that there's no such thing as a transit visa for SIN. \n- I rang my partner who spent two hours on the phone to MyTrip and Singapore Airlines, who both confirmed that no visa was needed. \n- I played her voice note to him and he said, I don't care who the hell this random English girl is saying.\n- Then I said, as you can see, Google also says I don't need a transit Visa and then he said, 'I don't care I only follow my rules'.\n- He said, 'You Afghans are ominous and foolish, always creating problems for us,' then he shouted and broke his pen hitting it in the ground.\n- I said my friend took off this morning with Turkish airlines with a 17 hours stay in Istanbul airport and he said 'don't lie, Afghans are not even allowed to travel by Turkish airlines'.\n- He then said, 'why is your trip so dodgy? Why so many stops? What is your plan? Why don't you book Mahan Iranian airlines and I will let you fly directly.' I believe that these comments were racially charged and highly subjective and unprofessional. \n- He was laughing with his colleagues saying, 'this Afghan wants to fly to Malaysia.' \n- I asked him nicely to provide me with a Singapore Airlines contact number but he refused and he said go find it yourself and ask them to email me or else you can't fly. However, he was on the phone with some airline service talking about me, I am pretty sure that person told him it's okay to let him board but to me he said no, you need a transit visa. \n- He was very unprofessional and inconsistent with his requests. At one point, he was saying I need a Dubai transit visa, then after a few minutes he'd say you no you need Singapore transit visa. Every 5 minutes he'd come up with a different requirement and logic. \n- He humiliated me by calling me a 'retarted and ominous Afghan,' \n- Also, I asked him to show me the details where it says I need a transit visa to SIN but he refused and said 'that's it. If you wanna go then you should book our own airline Mahan air.' There was another Afghan passenger trying to check in at this point too; she was crying out loud, because it was the second time she booked her flight and he refused to board her. \n- He also said to his colleague, loudly enough for us to hear, 'Oh! They all look different and that's an advantage, no one can realise they are Afghans.' \n\nTicket was booked through Mytrip who are saying that the ticket is under Singapore Airlines. They also won't help, saying that it is Mytrips's responsibility - lost six hundred dollars because of this!",

                    "I booked my flight Melbourne to Macau with a 13 hour stop in Singapore originally ( departure 18/11 and landed on Macau 19/11) via third party website. The connected flight to Macau is operated by your company owned Scoot. Even though SQ provides a month notice on the flight change (Singapore to Macau) from 19/11 to 20/11, there is no reason provided by any of the airline parties plus your company ruin my whole isolation hotel and PCR test arrangement. Doesn't your company realize how bad / tough to arrange the isolation hotel reservation in Macau. Absolutely both SQ and Scootfly know well with the COVID zero policy in China and Macau!!! Of coz SQ never knows how difficult it has been for me as a healthcare worker to arrange the very first trip and negotiated a 4 week annual leave with two bosses, two jobs since COVID pandemic occurred. I understand SQ may not have much power to modify my booking due to the third party policy; however, I confidently believe SQ still responsible for this issue. It is your company's decision to cancel the flight on 19/11 and rearrange it to 20/11. If I keep my current flight date, I am going to get stuck a day and a half in Singapore and need to solely arrange another accommodation and meals on my own cost while waiting for this new flight time. I don't think SQ is going to compensate me for things!!! \n\nI contacted to the third party agent and still was unable to change the departure flight date whatsoever because the third party is required to both send a request and confirm with SQ prior to modifying  my booking. It makes me so stressful and anxious about the whole situation. Moreover, It's so outrageous and unacceptable to let me expect additional cost/fee for the departure date change. How disgusting it can be to ask a customer for paying additional fee for departure date change on top of the flight fare because of your flight rearrangement/ cancellation. The SQ customer call centre is disappointingly hopeless and helpless to handle customer issues and enquiries. When I called the customer call centre, the representative simply referred me back to the third agent and couldn't be more than happy to hung up my call ASAP. What a \"great service\" from a top 3 airline company ! At the moment, I am still waiting for the response. How can SQ torture me like this?\n\nThe crazy thing about the issue is, SQ website is still selling the flight ticket on the same day  which the flight to Macau has been cancelled and rearranged by Scoot Fly. Your website is really misleading and trapping your customers!!! Is it that difficult to let me fly back home to see my family after three years of waiting? \n\nMy another bad experience with SQ was my trip to Istanbul from Melbourne in 2019. SQ cancelled my flight from Melbourne at the last minute without sending notification email/ SMS. The only explanation I received from the check-in crew about no notification was “the issue was occurred less than 4-5 hours, we won’t announce it publicly with that short time frame”. What a dumb policy ever!!! When I lived in the US, flight change is normal but I always received update/ notifications from airlines. That’s really a hallow excuse to not make update transparently to the passengers. This is not the end of the story. The same last-minute flight cancellation happened for my returned flight from Istanbul in the same trip. I ended up staying in Istanbul airport for 12 hours. The whole returned trip journey was 35+ hours with two stops in Malaysia and Singapore.\n\nI have flown with S@ since 2015. I have witnessed your service quality, transparency and customer-issue handling have gone downhill significantly. The top-notch customer service has become history !!!! If I had had options for my Macau trip, I would never and ever have considered SQ. I totally understand SQ has recently shifted its focus to business/ first class only and now doesn’t value economy-class customers no more like Cathay Pacific. It is questionable how your company captures one of the top 3 airline spots in the world comparing to your competitors Emirate and Qatar !!!!! Maybe your company pleases business and first class customers well to receive that high ranking !!!! Definitely no satisfaction from me your economy-class customer. I don't even want to conclude that SQ is being racist to the economy-class customers. If I can give them negative star on social media, airline review websites or airline ranking polls …. I would not hesitate to do so.",

I was charged $740.00 for a change flight when the mobile app I used to change my flight showed a charge of $0.00. I called within minutes after my credit card company notified me of this charge. The agent said there is nothing that can be done because the transaction was final… I asked to be put back on the original flight or be refunded the $740.00. The agent said that those options are not available to me and I asked to speak to a supervisor. After more than an hour, she let me know that she started an inquiry and that someone will follow up with me within 5 business days. That never happened.

They made us wait at the counter standing for 2 hours while they went back and forth wondering if my mother held a valid visa. I have advised them I have confirmation from immigration prior to the booking of the flight to ensure everything will be done smoothly. They we unsure and kept snapping pictures of my mothers visa and sending it via WhatsApp to God knows whom to enquire if it's acceptable- is that standard process? Snapping pictures of personal identification /passport and forwarding then on an unsecured platform?. They made us wait until the last 10 minutes and denied her boarding getting an executive decision from the manager NOT Malaysian immigration, who I have just gotten off the phone with and they have confirmed that the visa IS valid and she IS entitled entry into Malaysia. I am unable get in touch with anyone from your contact center to have this matter looked into as they have wrongfully denied my mother boarding. This has given us so much stress and anxiety and this is so appalling for what is touted to be a world class airline! If they had told me upfront that they will not be boarding her as they are unsure and given us some notice we could have gotten immigration on the phone and done something. Instead they waited untill the last moment and just walked away. This is beyond belief",

They were left having to wait at Singapore airport for another 8 hours for another flight. The airline was entirely unhelpful. The reason they missed their flight was entirely due to miscommunication from Singapore Air. They were afforded no courtesy, no help and no support.

In this case I was given my marching orders and I had to get on the first available flight. Given our pleasant past experiences with Singapore Air the decision was a no brainer. We arrived at the airport on time but Virgin Australia simply did not process us on time. We spent nearly an hour in the queue and the lady that was checking us in was new and needed support, to which none was forthcoming from the virgin team. Needless to say we missed our flight. Virgin were absolutely dreadful, lost our baggage, blamed us for being late even though we were waiting in their queue, then sold us it was not their problem, call Singapore Air, so we did. To make a long story short Singapore did nothing to resolve the issue, left our whole family stranded when I had a deadline to meet, charged us over $6000 and wanted to charge us more for missing the flight, and have not responded to our lost baggage claim or complaint. Put simply you are running a risk if you fly with Singapore because THEY DO NOT CARE AT ALL about their customers. I travel regularly, needless to say it will be with other cariers moving forward. It's a shame because I have nearly 200,000 kris flyer points with Singapore that will now be discarded.

I spent a couple of hours on the phone talking to both Lufthansa and Singapore airlines to organise the re-booking of her flight, i was bounced back and forth between the two trying to organise it before she had to check in from Melbourne.\n\nThe calls took so long i made it to Melbourne airport and instead talked to the service desk and asked about the cancellation and they said it will sorted by the time she arrived in Singapore. Her direct flight got switched out for a Singapore -> Delhi -> Amsterdam -> Frankfurt.\n\nAfter receiving the email of the change only half an hour before her landing at Singapore i tried to talk to Singapore airlines to her a replacement direct flight as due to medical and language barriers she would not be able to navigate the multiple stopovers.\n\nTwo hours on the phone got me nowhere and apparently every flight was booked for the destinations from Singapore to either Munich, Frankfurt, Amsterdam, Brussels, London or even back to Melbourne at which point a family member would be able to her get to her original destination without the insane amount of stopovers.\n\nThe staff just kept insisting there is no available flights even for the day after her arrival in Singapore.\n",
                    "If there was an option for no stars, I would select that.\n\nSingapore Airlines from Bangalore, India to Singapore which was set to depart at 0120 was delayed by ~3 hours. The flight reached Singapore at 1130. Due to this the connecting flight to Perth which was set to depart at 1200 was missed. Due to this I along with my partner had to stay in Singapore city overnight at our own expenses at a hotel.\n\nOn arrival in Singapore, I inquired with Singapore Airlines Duty Manager on what our options were as our onward journey had been disrupted due to this delay of almost 3 hours to which I was offered no solution at all. In fact, my request was brushed aside by the duty manager based on the fact that I did not have a connecting flight booked with Singapore Airlines or Scoot and that this situation was \"no longer Singapore Airlines Problem\". I explained to the Duty Manager that a missed connection (either with Singapore Airlines group or any other carrier for that matter) put us in a position where we would incur costs associated with accommodation, meals, transport and loss of pay (in my case) to which the duty manager responded that those would have to be borne at my expense even though the delay was caused by a Singapore Airlines. As mentioned earlier, the general gist of the responses I received from the duty manager was that \"this is not our problem\".\n\nThe treatment meted out to me by a duty manager was sub par to say the least and certainly was not expected from an airline which is considered to be among the best in the world. I even worte to them and they have conveniently told me that I need to check with my insurance company and that they aren't liable.",
                    "I have never experienced anything like this. \n\nThis is supposed to be one of the best airlines. Their pricing is premium but they have no customer services at all. \n\nForget changing your flights, receiving confirmation by emails or requesting assistance. You pay for your flight and then that s it. Good luck to you. No follow up, no one picks up the phone, no one replies emails and be prepared to queue hours if you are brave enough to visit their customer services branch. \n\nIt is shocking that after 2 years into a pandemic, they didn t manage to figure out how to hire and train new agents. \n\nPhoto attached: I was on hold for another 2 hours (total of 5.40 waiting time before someone picked up and hung the line.

Big surprise and consternation at this news as neither we nor our travel consultant had requested/received this flight refund/cancellation. Wife in tears for the next few days thinking she’d be stranded overseas or needing to pay a fortune for reaccessing her BC tickets home. Agreed to pay an extra $1708 to SAL @ Schiphol to obtain a BC seat for my wife.

I asked staff in the air craft if I was going go make the connection flight and was not given any information. Was provided with a new boarding pass once entering the airport, 35 minutes before my new flight was departing - well in time for me to make it, however, they said nothing could be done. \n\nWould be great to have gotten this information beforehand, e.g. improved communication with the customers in order to minimise unexpected and unwanted surprises.",

                    "I am beyond frustrated writing this review. I have never experienced such unprofessional behavior in my life. I wanted to change my date of departure so I tried to change it through the Singapore Airlines website. I tried to pay the difference in the fare as shown on the website. My payment could not be processed after trying for the last 8 days. I finally gave up and decided to contact the staff. After I filled in the online form for assistance with changing my date of departure, I got vague emails from them. When I put in another request for assistance, I got an email stating that my itinerary had been changed and that I had until the end of the following day to pay the fare difference and have my ticket issued. It did not say how I was supposed to pay the fare difference and get my ticket. I emailed the same person that sent me the previous email about my change in itinerary. In the email, I mentioned about the following day being a public holiday in my country and that there was no Singapore airlines office in my state. I asked if they could provide me a link to pay online and have my ticket issued. I am still waiting for a response. I will never fly Singapore airlines ever again. The worst customer service experience I have had so far. Will never recommend Singapore airlines to anyone.",

I initially tried to alter the return online but once my details were entered the same message... No flights available. I did a search on Skyscanner  and saw plenty of flights available. Emailed (customer don't care) They finally admitted after 2 emails there were other flights but my complimentary ticket could not be used. They then said my ticket was upgraded to flex and I could change it. Ok went through the procedure change from 16th to the 6th December the wanted £3,600 more! \nI then searched sky scanner for the two dates... Price difference £200.00 So where did £3,600 come from. Customer (don't )care said because other online service providers had other packages that Singapore  cannot offer?? \n\nNever again.",

My mother is 90 years old.  It is cruel and unusual to put someone through such a trial.  \n\nShe had tried rebooking the flight so many times, it got past the date for her flight, and now they are also trying to charge a \"no-show\" fee.

After contacting them three times (email twice and chat function once) h and waiting two weeks for a response, I have still not received a call or new flights. As the last straw, I bought a local sim card and tried calling the helpline. I was on hold for an hour, and then the line disconnected. I understand things might be difficult if I want to change my flights, but I am shocked at the response from Singapore when they cancelled the flights. I will never fly with this carrier again.",
                    "I booked my return flight to Europe for July 2023  in October 2022. I am a Krisflyer member. At the start of this year I received a text message from SQ saying I had been „off-loaded“ for my return flught. No further explanation was given. When I finally reached a customer service person on the phone after an hour wait, I was told the plane had been overbooked and no seats were now available. I was not on the flight any more.  I was offered to either rebook for the next day or get a refund for the flight - the latter was not an option as I need to get back home.  I agreed to be rebooked for a departure the following day. This means an additional cost as I have to stay at the airport hotel and I had to take 1 day unpaid leave from work. When I contacted the customer chat service, they said I had „volunteered“ by agreeing to the change and was therefore not entitled to any compensation.  No other airline I have flown with has ever tried to get away with such a low level of customer care and responsibility They offered me 2000  Krisflyer points, which is laughable- what can  you get for that?",
                    "Overall, my experience with Singapore Airlines is horrible because of the following:\n1. Flight was delayed by 7 hours (From 7:30PM to 2:30AM) apparently due to a natural calamity but as per peer feedback, only SG airline flights to manila were delayed. Other airlines flew as planned\n2. Concern in helpdesk was very subpar. We were just told that there was nothing they could do and that they are not liable for anything because it was a natural occurrence. As a result, i had to attend my meeting in Manila extremely tired\n3. Compensation for the delay was negligible. Also, there was a mistake on the communication on the establishments that we can claim our vouchers. The memo sent through mail mentioned an SG foodcourt. When we went there, apparently there was no communication regarding it. all to find out that it was applicable to burger kind, not the foodcourt. We were told after we paid for the dinner.\n4. We were told in the information area that since we were delayed for 7 hours, we are given access and food to the lounge. when we got to the lounge, they said there was no communication and we are not allowed in\n5. during the flight, no headphones were provided so couldn't maximize the entertainment system\n\nI am extremely disappointed with my experience and the service",

We tried calling multiple times but could not get through so eventually I emailed them. I received an email back stating that they have flights available that they will hold but I would have to call up to confirm. The extra cost would be $372 for and adult and $37 for my infant. Fine. I wasn’t left a telephone number that worked so I was left searching the internet for a new number and finally got through to an office.\n\nI explained above and they proceeded to tell me that the flights would now be $600 for an aldult and $150 for an infant- I asked why and apparently it was due to taxes. Yet this was not outlined at all in the email I received with the initial price. I told them that I would call back after having discussed with my husband.\n\nI called back and the person on the other end of the phone obviously didn’t want to help me so he said that I had called British airways and gave me a number that of course didn’t work. At this point I was so frustrated I asked my husband to call. He was happy to except the extra charges for “tax” by the time he finally got through (over an hour later) they changed the price to $8000 yep 8 thousand!!!! My husband said this isn’t good enough and asked to speak to the manager. He was put on hold for a further 30 minutes and when the ‘rep’ came back to him he said “have you decided if you want the flight or not?” My husband was fuming and needed to catch a flight himself so he decided he would just call back when he landed. \n\nWhen he landed, my husband called again. This time the price was ‘just’ $5700 😡 my husband once again asked to speak with someone higher up and was told the manager was busy and would just tell him the same thing. \n\nI tried calling again, I got through to a lady that was about to give me a new price but I explained that I already had a confirmed email I just needed to pay the difference. She actually asked me to send the email to her. First email address she gave me was different from the second. She kept saying it wasn’t coming through- so I said send an email to me and I’ll send one back. She wasn’t able to do that apparently. So I decided to just keep hitting send……against and again. Finally she received it. Then told me I’m at the wrong department and she would get someone to call me back but didn’t know when that would be. I’m still waiting.",

How can I agree to pay 20k for tickets online priced at 2500 that's makes no sense at all.

Calling in - the wait takes forever (~1-2hours) to get on the phone with an agent and twice I ended up getting transferred to commerical and they set up an artificial schedule to give you a call back. Promised a 72 hours call back twice but never happened.\n\n2. Chatting with kris bot - you will meet 3 typical scenarios.\n\n(Scenario A) a generic all our customer service representatives are currently engaged and we are unable to attend to you at the moment. For urgent assistance, get in touch with us here [singaporeair.com/contactus].\n\n(Scenario B) once in a while you will get in line but eventually they will drop you out of the queue.\n\n(Scenario C) you get transferred to reservations or another department they would spend 30 mins checking your account and reply with a generic “The request I will place will be sent to our relevant department. We would not know at what date and time they would be able to pick up on the said request and how long would they need to review it”\n\n3. Filling up an online form - you get a generic automated acknowledgment. We are currently encountering high volume and will do our best to respond to you within 15 business days. Not sure what business decide that it was ok to have a 3 weeks turnaround time\n\nAttached all the pics for reference.\n\nUpdated:\n- MAY 29 2022- exactly on par with their 15 days turnaround time\n\n1. Call back - finally got a call from the agent 15 days later, basically advising no fix can be done and provide a very generic speech on how you should call them 24 hour ahead of flight to ensure in the future.\n\nThe initial issue was the agent at the counter in the airport messed up, SQ wouldn’t fix the issue, and basically putting the blame on the customer and I wanted to escalate it.\n\n2. Transcript - Phone was recorded but transcript cannot be sent by email\n3. Escalation - Agent cannot escalate issue, suggested using the generic feedback form online to escalate\n4. Manager - Asked to be transferred to the manager, manager was on the phone so have to wait for a call back on someday and sometime. Guess the waiting game continues\n\nSome recommendations\nA. Provide training - personally I felt like some of the agents at the counter honestly lack training.\nB. Stay away from prepared speech - fix the issue, listen to the customer, not read off this word doc of a generic solution of how to fix this in the future\nC. Hire additional staffs - 3 weeks turnaround  time quoting COVID 19 as an excuse doesn’t sound acceptable anymore, it’s 2022.",
                    "So we originally booked to go to Japan for Cherry Blossom season in late 3/2020.  However, that flight was canceled due to COVID.  At that time we wanted our money back, not knowing how long the pandemic would last, but Singapore Air only lets us get credit to book for another flight through them WITHIN 1 year.  They didn't know how long the pandemic would last but they were so arrogant to think that the customer can and will have no other choice but to book another flight.\n\nAfter backs and forth on the phone (which took a good 6 to 8 hours of wait at that time) we got tired so gave in and booked another flight to Japan in 11/2020.  This was within the 1 year limit (which they start on the date you did the booking of your first flight, not from the day of the actual first flight). \nAnd of course the pandemic continued so the 11/2020 flight got canceled by Singapore Airlines.  \nBack to the pain of trying to contact them for refund because they sure as hell isn't going to automatically refund us.  They promised within 18 weeks due to high volume of refund demands.  Guess what?  It has been more than 4 months and still nothing.  \n\nThis company is a piece of bowel defecation scammer.

He called the next day to confirm approval of a new number and patiently went through my reservation to be sure the information was accurate.\nWow!  I'm so grateful this kind agent went out of his way to help!",
                    "When I booked my flight I had tentative dates. Singapore airlines stated at the time of booking that I could rebook my flight and only pay the difference for a new flight. \n\nI have now gone to rebook my flight twice and have had no luck in being able to rebook my flight. When I search on the Singapore Airlines website, there are plenty of economy seats to book. However, when I try to convert my ticket to these dates with available seats, I am told these seats are reserved for 'new customers only'. There are therefore no dates I can change my flight to, rendering their rebooking system as completely useless and a total scam! \n\nIf you are unsure of your dates, by no means trust their rebooking system. I now have to forfeit my flight without a refund. What a complete joke.",
                    "Singapore Airlines used to be a premier, fine service airline, but it is now the worst I have flown---and this was business class.  My flight was cancelled at the last minute, and the few folks that were herding a plane load of passengers had no idea what to do.  I was finally rebooked 24 hours later, but Singapore Airlines had not transferred the payment info, so the subsequent airline would not issue a boarding pass.  There was NO ONE from Singapore Airlines around and after 1.5 hours on hold, I was able to remedy the situation myself.  I will NEVER fly Singapore Air again.  If their handling of this disaster on the ground is any indication of their handling an in-the-air emergency, the entire plane of passengers would be dead.",
                    "@SingaporeAir We have been scammed by a website that has cloned Singapore Airlines website & inserted a scam number 02034816921 and taken payment for two flights LHR to CHANGI on the 22/12/2022 supposedly returning on the 9/1/2022 How can Singapore Airline security allow this ?",
                    "In February 2023 we booked a trip to visit our Daughter in New Zealand. Because of past experience with flights we ensured that the 'Layovers' were not too long but just as importantly - not too short so that a party containing people in a wheelchair had a chance to make connecting flights if a leg was 'delayed'.\n\nThis was done in good faith.\n\nOn four separate occasions our travel agent subsequently  had to contact us to advise is that the carrier ;Singapore Airlines had changed the schedule, with the 3rd change made (so we really couldnt cancel and re-book due to other airline lack of availability) whereby we ended up with a layover in singapore in excess of half a day, and a change of transit point and layover time in new -zealand from AUckland to Chrishchurch with just 90 minutes between flights!!!!\n\nWhat chance of us or our luggage making that connection???\n\nWhat have shambolic airlines offered us in recompense - platitudes and apologies - We have spent in excess of £18,000 on premium economy flights to wellington, and now that they have our money and we cant get it back - Just 'Sorry' and 'Sod Off'! \n\nFly with them again? Book with them again?\n\nNEVER - (How on EARTH were they awarded airline of the year 2023 - certainly not for customer service)\n",

                    "Singapore Airlines lost my suitcase for 3 weeks and it was returned to me 3 weeks later, at the end of my holidays. I have been unsuccessfully trying to contact them via emails, feedback forms, phone and there has been no reply.\nTerrible customer service. I won't be flying with them again.",
                    "We flew with Singapore airlines from Copenhagen to Singapore, then from Singapore to Cairns on a Sunday. One of our luggage was lost. At Cairns airport, we have been told not to worry : when the luggage would be found, it would be delivered to us, wherever we may be. We insisted on the fact that we were on a 3 weeks road trip and would be moving every day, a little further to Sydney, but the staff at the airport reassured us they would send the luggage wherever we may be. \n\nWe had a first call with an employee of Singapore Airlines, named Suzan, on Monday, saying that the company lost the luggage. She promised to call again the next day to inform us about the ongoing investigation to find it. We insisted again on the fact that we were on the move and Suzan said it wouldn't be a problem to send the luggage at a specific address.  \n\nUnlike what was promised, we had no news on the next day. We then tried to reach Singapore Airlines on the next day, without success. That’s indeed when we found out that the number she used to call us was only one way: we couldn’t call it, only it could call us. Suzan finally called back on the evening of the Wednesday saying that our luggage was found.  \n\nWhen we said that we would be in Ingham the next day, we were answered that it was too far to deliver the luggage! We were very surprised by this answer and started arguing on that topic, since we've been told the exact opposite since the beginning. When we asked if there could be a compensation linked to the loss, Suzan laughed at us, which we found very disrespectful. She even ended up hanging up on us!  \n\nAs we were wondering about what just happened to us (maybe it was the “Australian way” to deal with customers), another employee of the company called us back right away. We then found a compromise: since we were passing by the city of Innisfail on the next day (Thursday), we agreed to meet a courier there to get our luggage back. We gave our itinerary of the next days: after visiting the falls of Milaa Milaa and Elinja, we would be heading to Mamu Tropical Skywalk. We were almost sure not to have phone reception there and informed them that we would only be reachable when arriving closer to Innisfail, around 12 (lunchtime), time at which we agreed to meet the delivery person. \n\nThe driver was supposed to have been given our contact details and to call us when leaving Cardwell in the morning to set up a meeting point in Innisfail. We arrived at 11.30 AM in Innisfail and then waited for the driver’s call to head up to a specific meeting point. But we received no call, and we waited for 1h30 in Innisfail for the driver to call us. We even tried to call Singapore Airlines, but every person we were speaking to had no idea of what the situation was, neither who to re-direct us too, they simply advised us to send another email. Since we had to be in Ingham at the end of the day (we had a hotel reservation there), we couldn't stay any longer and had to move. During our trip to Ingham, we took time to write an email to the email contact we had received in Cairns to explain the situation. We had Wifi that night and the next morning but received no answer to our email. At that moment we were very stressed because we had no idea what could have happened to our luggage. \n\nThe next day, Friday, we had to reach Townsville because we had a ferry booking to go to Magnetic Island. When we were on Magnetic Island (with poor reception), we received a call at 11 AM – the exact time he was supposed to call us the day before.\n\nWhat happened during that call was beyond disrespect. The person pretended that he tried to call, and email us the day before without success. He even mentioned having sent at least 10 text messages to both our numbers. Which is very strange because we had reception for sure from 11.30 AM, since we managed to contact Singapore airlines helplines ourselves. We received no text message nor email! He also said that since he couldn't contact us, he went up to Mamu Tropical Skywalk and consulted the register (that everybody is supposed to sign but we never were asked to at any time) to find out we never went there. We were so shocked because it meant that he was calling us liars. We went to Mamu Tropical Skywalk, we have pictures of the place and we have hotel reservation in Yungaburra and Ingham to prove our itinerary too. So we can’t understand why he would use this excuse.\n\nOn top of that, he said that he had money compensation with him, but since we didn’t show up in Innisfail, he wouldn’t give us the money anymore. Which means that since this day, we didn’t receive the compensation mentioned. And to finish the call, the driver informed us that we had no other choice than going to Townsville's airport to collect our luggage in the afternoon, otherwise, they wouldn’t take care of our file anymore. So in the end, the promise to deliver the luggage wherever we were was never met. \n\nWe were so angry and frustrated during the call, that we stopped arguing and just wanted to get the luggage back not to waste our holidays with stress anymore. Another really strange thing: following this call, we both received a text message from him, from Suzan and also an email to confirm where the luggage would be sent, and we received all text messages, calls and emails sent at that time on both phones. We wonder why we didn’t receive anything the day before.\n\nTo sum up, it took Singapore Airlines 5 days to get us the luggage back. We received only 150 Australian Dollars to cover this loss, which was clearly not enough to cover 5 days of clothing / hygiene product / snorkeling equipment / ... that was in the luggage. We waited 1h30 in Innisfail for nothing. We had been charged for international calls with both our phones several times due to the poor communication of both companies. We had suffered a great deal of stress and frustration, we had been laughed at and disrespected and we had been called liars! \n\n ",

We got off the plane at Singapore to then get back on the same plane to go to Bangkok.\nWhen we arrived at Bangkok we were greeted by someone holding up a sign with our name on it.\nThey then informed us that our bags were back in Bangkok.\nWe were told that the bags were on the next flight which would arrive at 7pm. We had to leave airport around 7pm due to a paid pickup waiting.\nWe were told that the bags would be delivered to the hotel.\nThey finally arrived at the hotel at 11.30 pm.\nThis meant we were awake for 24 hours , and tired.\nFirstly, how can you lose a bag which should have stayed on the plane, and secondly, why did it take so long to be delivered to the hotel?\nThere were other travellers from Adelaide on the same flight who had this happen.\nNot a great look and start to a long awaited holiday.",
                    "after a 48 hour flight transferring from Macau to Singapore to LA, Singapore Airlines somehow lost, and sent my daughters luggage to a completely unknown place in the world. We’ve called everyday for updates but not a SINGLE person from Singapore baggage service cares, and there has been no trace reports or information given since 9/20. We have a ton do priceless family items as well as critical prescribed medicine inside the luggage. This is absolutely unacceptable. --",

They even updated their website after the incident yet would not return my belongings. Company run like a authoritarian regime, which singapore actually is. Customer service is a joke. Would never ride with them again. Must have bribed someone to get whatever good rating they’ve gotten in the past.",
                    "Hi,\n\nI travelled from Paris to Melbourne with Singapore airlines.\nThis is how I got my luggage back.\nNo one at the airport wanted to help me, they said to lodge it online.\nAs per screenshot the luggage from does not work.\nI tried on mobile, laptop, different browsers.\n\nNobody responding the chat. \n\nI called 0011 65 6223 8888 they said to use the form that doesn’t work. Then they said to call 0466404514 which says that the voicemail is full and to call back.\n\nI messaged on Facebook and Instagram, no answers as well.\n\nI believe that the will just ignore my query until I give up.\n\nI need to purchase a new suitcase to travel back to Paris.\n\nAnd Singapore airlines couldn’t care less about it. \n\nI travelled with lots of company. \nI recommend to use another company even if the price is higher. Yo won’t get such poor service.\n\nThank you.",

I booked direct with Singapore airlines to support them and avoid third part interfaces. Very disappointing. Please consider who you fly with\nThe photo shows some factual news:",
                    "I have been a regular customer of Singapore Airlines for decades and am disappointed to see how much their level of service/ competence has deteriorated during the pandemic. I booked a return flight from Toronto to Singapore from Air Canada (i.e. the marketing carrier). I do have a checked luggage allocation of 3 bags. As per SIAs own baggage policy, the first marketing carrier's baggage policy applies (see picture below). Despite me showing them a copy of their own airline's policy, they were adamant that their policy of 2 bags applies. \n\nI had to repack my bags at the airport, which is something I've never had to do in my life and a complete hassle. It is also something that I find embarrassing to do.\n\n It is really unfortunate that SIA no longer pays any attention to staff training and /or update their publically policies. I have many options when transiting on my frequent travels and will definitely think twice about travelling via Sinagpore in the future.\n\nThis is not a fake review. My flight number is SQ600 departing at 8am Jan 20 2023.",
                    "This Singapore Airline is so bad. I lost my luggage for already 3 days, no help, no service. Stranded in Indonesia without my clothes and personal belongings and Singapore airlines doesn't care. I have been calling for 3 days, they do not pick up the phone, do not give me any information about my luggage. They just do nothing. They do not even care how I can survive. The worst airline and service at all!!!!!!! Never again to fly with this airline!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",
                    "I discovered that my luggage was crushed when I arrived at Kuala Lumpur International Airport, with items such as shoes and shirts being damaged and soil. I postulated that after the luggage was crushed, contents from my bag probably spilled out of the bag. In addition, my phone charger was missing as well.\n\nIt is normal that this happens to a luggage from time to time. What was shocking was SIA's response (or lack thereof).\n\nOn the date of arrival (17 Apr), I was told that I will receive a one-for-one luggage exchange and SIA will contact me shortly. \n\nSince then, SIA has not provided any details of the compensation, such as the luggage size/type/color that I will be receiving. When queried about the delay, I was told that they needed to investigate the case of the missing charger. This was when I got truly puzzled - you cannot work on the compensation for an urgent and valuable items such as a luggage, because you needed to figure how the phone charger went missing.\n\nI have attempted to call all the SIA hotlines available to me in Kuala Lumpur and well, the waiting time is longer than your wait at hotpot shops like Hai Di Lao, and you still can't reach an operator!\n\nI gave up and decided to contact them through a Facebook post. Alas, I thought there was a glimmer of hope when they replied. I followed their instructions and emailed them my previous correspondence with them. And I received a reply that my concerns have been forwarded to the relevant department. No phone calls, no point-of-contacts, but just a generic email to ask someone who has been waiting for 5 days for his patience.\n\nThis used to be an airlines that prided itself on service. But as other comments have mentioned, Singapore Airlines isn't what it used to be anymore.",
                    "Singapore Airlines has been my favorite airline, and I probably have traveled the maximum number of times.\n\nMy travel this time has been probably the worst I have ever traveled before. Here is a concise summary of the problems I faced and still facing\n\n1) SQ 31: Bad In-flight service, No snacks were offered. Very slow/ineffective attendants. Bad food.\n\n2) SQ 516: Terrible In-flight service. I ordered a special meal 24hrs before, and it had been accepted in the system, but I was told their printout does not show it. On top of it, while serving the drinks, our row was missed, and when reminded, the flight attendant shouted, saying waaaaaaiiiiiit. No snacks and Bad food again!\n\n3) That's not the end. After all the inconvenience I went through, when I landed, I got an SMS saying my bag was delayed. I went to the lost & found and filed the baggage lost form, and I was told that it would come on the next day flight and would be delivered the following day. Since then, I have made 2 phone calls to the lost & found department (they have been nice) and numerous phone calls to Dalui & Sons - the delivery partner (very very bad service). I finally got the bag after 5 Days.\n\n4) More details on Lost  Bag\nThe Singapore air check-in counter suggested checking in small baggage as well, which I did. I had some important, regular prescription medicines in my bag, but the delay due lost bag impacted me. I raised a complaint to Singapore airlines, and they royally ignored it. No response. What a joke this airline has become.\n\nFinally, with all this trouble, I am not so looking for my flight back to San Francisco. This would be my last Singapore airlines flight. Not worth the $3000 ticket per person round trip.",

Never, ever will I fly with them again.",

However I am yet to receive a single response from them and neither has there been an update nor any compensation for my loss.\nI'm astonished that an international carrier like Singapore Airlines could get away with such unethical behaviour.",

And not forget to mentioned but the planes from both Perth to Tokyo and Tokyo to Perth was quite dirty and dusty. We can see they don’t clean the seat pockets as we find the used tissues and plastics were not cleaned . When we arrived at Perth , same story happens again , one of our luggage missing . We talked to the (Dnata) baggage handling desk lady and her respond was so rude. She said we can’t track your luggage so we don’t know anything . We are here just for customer service . Very very unprofessional and very loudly screaming to the customer . She keep\nSaying she don’t know so please don’t ask anymore , once we got your luggage we will deliver to your house. \nOverall very unpleasant and stressful flight .

Pretty disgusting like flying on budget airline.\n\nUpon arrival i found my luggage was damaged. but i was too tired to report it on that day. However i put this on my feedback form around 1 day after my arrival and no response from them.  after 10 days, i send another feedback using the web form and get a reply from their Customer Affairs Supervisor that they cannot do anything as i reported more than 7 days. \n\nPaying more for Singapore airlines, i expect they can at least do investigation to find possible issue or make promise to improve the quality - which they did not share any. not even an apology. \n\nThis is not Singapore airline that i know. super disappointing.\n\n",

                    "So airlines occasionally lose luggage. It is annoying but it happens. It is the response to losing luggage that truly shows how good an airlines coroner service is. \nUnfortunately for a friend of mine, Singapore Airlines has failed dismally. \n\nSingapore Airlines lost the suitcase with all her belongings en route to Darwin. \n\nAfter making a report the item was missing the airline kicked into action and told her it had likely been identified. \n\nOk, good news right? Er, no. Singapore Airlines has now held on to the bag for four days. Each day we go through the hassle of chatting with a robot until we convince it to allow us to contact a human, who assures us that we will receive a call back. Each day the call never comes. \n\nThe baggage service only says that the case is \"pending\" with no explanation as to what pending means. \n\nWill the bag ever be released by the airline? Why haven't they brought it to Australia yet? Are they lazy? Is it too expensive?\n\nThere must be some reason. \n\nAnyways, in a nutshell: avoid Singapore Airlines if you can. They seem great when things go right. But when things go badly they go terribly badly and there is no-one at the airline willing to help.",

Almost 48 hours after lodging a delayed baggage report,  we've had zero update on progress and bags not found. We have all our travel belongings plus medication in those bags. The delayed luggage team at the airport aren't returning messages, not picking up their phones and their message bank is now full.

                    "Singapore airlines deliberately decided not to load my vessel with my suitcase and gave me no heads up in regards to this. When I arrived at my final destination - after 2 other stops - , I didn't see it, went to the baggage claim desk and was told that the aircraft was too heavy to carry my suitcase - I never even conceived that an airline could actively simply decide that, without any communication or negotiation, they could just not load your luggage and leave you waiting for it, powerlessly, at the airport; and then have you go through all the stress of chasing it for days. They opened a ticket to track my suitcase and many emails have been sent saying that it hasn't been found yet. Their Brisbane office does not answer the only phone number provided to me. Sydney's office took literally one hour to answer my call and said it was able to find it and assign a flight to it, which should arrive tonight - 2 full days after my arrival -. I have WET clothes in there that are being damaged and damaging other goods while they don't send the suitcase, and other important articles for my everyday use, like clothes and leather shoes to go to work. I'm having to work from home as a result, against my company's policy. Although Sydney said there was a flight assigned to my suitcase, I kept receiving emails saying it wasn't located yet, and that they \"were doing their best\" to find it, so I also had contradictory information from their team.\nI wasn't given a final date to have this resolved, nor any sort of compensation offer from the airline. This is very poor customer handling and has ruined that entire Singapore Airlines experience, which already hadn't had any stand-outs. \n\nSolely for that reason, I would NEVER advise anyone to fly Singapore Airlines. Ever.",
                    "Although I had checked-in my luggage and paid the excess baggage fee as per Singapore Airlines policy, the airline managed to lose it somewhere between takeoff and the transfer in Singapore.  After a gruelling 19 hour flight I landed at my destination only to realise my passport was also was missing.  I notified the cabin crew as well as the ground staff at OR Tambo International Airport immediately, and I was told they would look for it and contact me if they found it.  To this day, they haven't located it and I had to pay for a passport re-issue which costs twice the price without any compensation from the airline, even though it either went missing or was stolen onboard their aircraft.  \n\nTo make matters worse, I was told that my checkin baggage couldn't be located.  I immediately completed a delayed baggage file form, and called the airline and the airport for regular updates regarding my baggage. Eventually, nearly a month later my baggage was located and the airline manager at OR Tambo International very kindly delivered it to my home address.  \n\nHowever, despite completing a delayed baggage claims form as I was told to I have still not been compensated for all  the costs I incurred as a result of the airline not upholding its end of the deal.  I paid the checkin baggage fee, as well as the excess baggage fee with the expectation that it would land in SA when I did.  But it didn't, and instead I had to spend money on purchases I otherwise wouldn't have had to make.  Moreover, I wasted a lot of time and airtime trying to sort out an issue which wasn't my fault.  I have since contacted the airline and the airport countless times hoping that my delayed baggage claim will be processed, but sadly, my efforts have been to no avail.  Singapore airlines refuses to take accountability for its horrendous service, and because of this, I will never ever fly with them again, and I urge anyone else who has travel plans to consider flying with a more affordable airline which provides far better service than this.",

I have been flying SIA back when they were still Malaysia Singapore Airways. I've always been impressed by the quality of the service until my last trip from Cape Town to Bali. In short, one of our bags never made it. I understand this can happen. It is not just the inconvenience of a lost bag it is also mourning the loss of memories for the items that were in the bag. \n\nRepeated phone calls and visits to the airport never resulted in the case being closed. It has been a year since the bag was lost and intermittent and sparse communication still leaves us wondering about being compensated and being done with this issue.

                    "I'm an American business executive flying Singapore Airlines (SIA) for the first time. I usually fly business-class on United Airlines (Premier 1K member). I thought I would give SIA a try given my new responsibilities include managing the South East Asia region for my company. Upon arrival to my final destination, I received an automated text from SIA notifying my baggage was delayed and subsequently, will be on another flight tomorrow morning. A bit of an inconvenience was my initial thought as all my business clothes and personal belongings like underwear were in my checked baggage. Mistakes happen and SIA will make it right. WRONG!!! The next morning arrived and no baggage as well as no updates. My hotel's concierge kept checking for me too and did not receive any updates. Meanwhile, I am calling SIA customer service throughout the day on a status, each time SIA responds they are escalating my issue and somebody will be in touch with me. I plead to SIA that I need to purchase business clothes for internal and customer facing meetings which is the point of my business trip. I can't keep delaying and waiting for my baggage while my internal and external customers are frustrated with me. SIA tells me to make the purchases, but keep the receipts for reimbursement. I proceed to make the necessary purchases in order to fulfill the objectives for my business trip. This is time consuming as I must go to the mall, fight the crowds, try on clothing, etc. during the workday when I should be meeting with internal and external customers. More than a week later, my baggage shows up at my hotel unannounced. Nobody from SIA contacts me, and when I call SIA customer service, even they aren't aware that my luggage was delivered to me. Finally, I begin the reimbursement process with SIA, and the REAL nightmare begins. And I thought the worst was behind me. SIA refuses to be held accountable, punting responsibilities over to local lost & found. Lost and found tries to negotiate with me with a low ball offer in local currency, as if they are not responsible for the damages caused to my reputation at my company resulting from their mishandling of my baggage. I tell them I am an American and demand to be reimbursed in USD to which they ignore me and continue to offer a petty amount in local currency. This is still unresolved because I refuse to be unfairly compensated for the damages and pain I had to endure. I told SIA they have ruined their prestige reputation and should not expect American business-class travelers to fly with them. They simply don't know how to deal with foreign business-class travelers, they think they can just ignore you which they probably get away with dealing with local travelers. As an American business traveler you are better flying with U.S. based carriers like United Airlines or Delta Airlines which won't try to screw you when they lose your baggage. More importantly they know how to deal with profitable American business-class travelers.",

                    "Booked a flight from COK-SIN and SIN-LAX both under Singapore airline.COK-SIN flight got delayed by 20-30 minutes and still I reached before boarding time for next flight SIN-LAX.But baggage handling of SIN airline was so pathetic that they refused to shift my luggage to next flight due to insufficient time.I was not allowed to shift/hand carry it myself as well.These idiots gave me a flight after 14 hours later to SIN-LAX.Tried contacting customer care but no to response.Lost my whole day and never flying again on this piece of s—t.\nPathetic service and hospitality.",
                    "I flew with Singapore air last month. My son's bag was lost for 11 days and other 5 passengers, who flew the same as my fly, lost their bags. I spent 3 hours at the airport after the plane landed and there was only one employee, who wrote a report, gave me a Property Irregularity Report(PIR). Next three days,  I was trying call to their customer service many days, but there was no response. So, I had to drive two times from Riverside to LAX to check my son's bag and they wasn't able to find my son bag. I had to restock my son's Enfamil, diapers, cloths, baby pacifier, and baby bottles and my stuffs too. This is not what I deserve from the airline. \nAfter day 12, they found my son's bag, so I had to drive to pick up from lost and found at LAX airport again. My bag was dent and had a black scratch on it. \nI wrote an e-mail to feedback on singapore airline to claim my son's bag but they didn't want to pay my son's bag that was dented. I asked them that I don't want their compensate but I just want my son's bag because we love the bag that was dented. I feel disappointed with Singapore airline customer service how they deal with their customers because I pay thousand dollars for this trip. If I change my fly schedule, I have to pay for a few hundred dollars. \nI have been flying for more then 20 years and I never lost my bag. This  is my first time and first experienced with Singapore airline. \nI don't recommend you to fly with Singapore airline because they have the worse customer service.",
                    "Checked in 4 baggage at the same time.  Received only 3. Travelling for a wedding and all the suits are now missing. Paid premium airfare and choose Singapore Airlines because of the name and reputation but they have let us down.",
                    "Cracked a tennis racquet in oversized baggage. You would think oversized baggage means they handle it more carefully, though clearly not. tennis racquet cracked on the edge due to compression of some sort. \n\nNot a lot of compensation required yet the airline refused to accept accountability.\n\nWe did inspect our baggage post flight, within 7 days, however this crack is not something you will see upon a quick look. We only found out when we played tennis 9 days after our flight.",
                    "Recently my parents travelled from Singapore to Colombo and there baggage did not recieved with them. The numbers they have provided are not working and there is absolutely no way to get any information about it.

                    "Went to Maldives with a transit flight via Singapore. First of all, they put us on scoot airways for the first flight, which appeared to be a budget version of Singapore airlines. The plane was old, had no in flight entertainment and was definitely not singapore airlines. Then after being put on a singapore airlines flight for the 2nd part of the journey, to our horror our baggage never made it to the Maldives. We put in a baggage tracking support ticket, went to our resort and waited for 2 days. We had to stay at our resort with nothing but the clothes on our back for two days. Eventually we learned that our luggage had been put on to a flight to Sri Lanka. How the f*** do airline staff do something so stupid? Then instead of sending it direct to Maldives from Sri Lanka, they put it back on a flight to singapore. We received no apology, no compensation and the customer support is impossible to contact. This airline is not worth any chance no matter how good a deal the flight tickets are.\n\nApparently the resort staff also said that it is not uncommon for singapore airlines to lose your luggage too. So yeah definitely avoid.",
                    "Here are my details of my trip. \n2nd March, 2023 – I flew with Delta to JFK in order to connect with Singapore airlines – JFK-FRA-SIN-HKT , due to arrive 4th March, 2023. When I arrived at JFK, on my way to collect my luggage I saw a Singapore desk in the area. So, I decided to stop and ask for directions: where to get my bag and where to check in with Singapore airlines. It was staffed by 2 individuals. While asking for directions and informing them that I will pick up by luggage from Delta and bring it across to the check-in desk. They both told me that it wasn’t necessary, just show them my Delta tag and my itinerary and they will have my luggage picked up and delivered to Singapore. I asked them twice if they are sure because Delta is not Star alliance. However, my luggage wasn’t picked up from the Delta carousel. \n3rd March, 2023 – Attempt to ask and verify my luggage was on board to a Singapore rep in Frankfurt, where I was told that she was too busy to help me I should come back later. \n4th March, 2023 – I arrived in Singapore and I went to T2 service desk (near F30) and was told that my luggage is in the system, it would arrive in Phuket. \nI arrived in Phuket but my luggage was missing, I was first told by the ground staff in Phuket that it was in Singapore and would arrive the next day and that I should make a claim. I did just that.\n\n5th March, 2023 – I waited 2 days before I realized that I was receiving no assistance from Singapore airlines except for e-mails stating that they are sorry for the delayed baggage. That’s when I had to take action on my own. I received this message about 10 times over the past few days. \"We are still trying to locate your delayed bag(s) and will provide another update by tomorrow. You can also check the status here, with your reference number.\"\n6th March, 2023 – I decided to check myself to locate my luggage and found it on Delta’s website, I then tried to call Singapore – JFK and inform them of the situation and this is when they told me that they couldn’t help me and hung up the phone when I asked to speak to a supervisor.  Erroneously thinking that since I found the luggage that I would receive some help as I have been without clothes, toiletries and medicine for 2 days. \nI finally got through to Singapore JFK via e-mail and they now asked me for a photo  of my bag and of my flight details and boarding passes before they can help me. How bizarre? \n\nQuestions for Singapore Airlines:\n1.\tWhy was I told by JFK ground staff that my luggage on Delta airlines would be transferred to Singapore airlines, when it wasn’t. Even though I offered twice to retrieved my luggage myself the two staff members insisted that it wasn’t necessary as it will be handled. It wasn’t and of today 9th March, 2023 I still don’t have my luggage.\n2.\tWhy is it at FRA airport where I was in transit that no staff was at the Singapore desk for most of the day. I did manage to find a person at the gate that told me they were too busy to assist me – I wanted to verify that my luggage was indeed transferred. \n3.\tWhy was I told when I arrived in Singapore by the staff at the service desk (next to F30) that my luggage was in the system and would be at my final destination – Phuket.\n4.\tWhy could the ground staff at Phuket airport and Singapore airline online unable to find my luggage and kept sending e-mails that they have contacted every station for information.\n5.\tWhy is it that when I called the Singapore customer service at JFK airport in NYC they told me that they can’t help me and hung up on my call.\n6.\tMost important – Why is it when I located the luggage myself 2 days later – as it was with Delta and informed all parties that my bag was in JFK Delta office that no personnel from either Singapore office made any attempt to retrieve my luggage. I had to call Delta in Atlanta and ask them to contact Singapore ground staff at JFK and inform them that the luggage they are looking for is at JFK.",
                    "We have used Singapore Airlines many times as it flies direct out of Adelaide. Our flight over was fine even though the food was truly awful. \nOn our return flight our bag was being transferred from a connecting flight from Vientiane for our flight back to Adelaide. We made it back fine but no luggage.\nOur bag has not yet been returned even though I have an air tag inside it and I have provided Singapore Airlines with a photo of where the bag is located in Changi Airport. It is so frustrating to know exactly where it is and has been since we landed there and yet still get the standard line...we are still trying to locate your bag. I wonder if any one actually looks? Our positive view of the Airline has collapsed as a result.",
                    "Review of Singapore Airlines Flight SQ227 Singapore to Melbourne 12 September 2023\n\nOn reflection, just another flight locked into the entertainment world available on the back of the seat in front of us before sleep overwhelmed the world? Well, yes, but the most memorable thing about flight SQ227 was the sense of the few people involved - or so it seemed at the time. Sure, there may have been estimated 280 fellow passengers and crew on the Airbus 350-900* that night but, there was this sense of flying >6,000 km Singapore to Melbourne with just a handful of other people – a relatively short flight and time moved quickly.\n\nChecking into Terminal 3 at Changi Airport was a doddle – drop-off from the taxi in front of the terminal and straight into a large empty cavernous terminal. There against the pillar to the left was the single scales to check weights. Then the short trolley walk across to the self-service check-in machine – which provided boarding cards and luggage tags – the instructions on the screen had been clear and easy to understand. Finally, the baggage drop-off on the conveyor behind. Again, the instructions were clear. You need to stand out of the way as the machine photos/registers your separate bags one-after-the-other before they disappear into the back blocks of the airport.\n\nWe seemed to have had the place to ourselves – there had been no one ahead of us and there was no friendly help waiting to check our bags at the auto-check-in machine. Staff from an adjacent manned check-in had watched from a distance. Pleased with our experience so far and, with plenty of time in-hand, we headed for the café behind check-in to share coffee before our Singapore minder returned home. It was a novel experience.\n\nThe first people en masse we saw were our fellow travellers queuing to gain access to the lounge at the gate. But even here such was the large size of the lounge, with everyone seated and few people standing around the departure gates to the air bridge, the place seemed empty. It was quiet. Boarding was called – orderly, quick and still quiet. With seats at the rear of the aircraft, we boarded with the first of the economy passengers.\n\nIt was a night flight departing 22.00 h which meant darkness most of the way - window blinds came down immediately the plane lifted. There was an evening meal around midnight and then heads down. Melbourne is two hours ahead of Singapore, so that meant 7.30 h or so flying time. With sunrise around 06.00 h in Melbourne we could have expected light in the cabin for the final hour of the flight except most people appeared to be sleeping through – blinds down and the cabin remained dark until the ‘breakfast’ snack arrived an hour before the final descent from Adelaide-on. You could follow the flight path on the screen.\n\nFood services had been exemplary – courteous, efficient, ‘that extra mile’, etc. Dinner was delicious – shrimp/salad starter, hot veggies/meat main and strawberry dolce to follow. Cheese & biscuits too. The ‘breakfast’ snack before landing – mushroom and potato wrap – was less attractive – too savoury. Where were the alternative cornetti to compliment the coffee? We figured breakfast at Tullamarine Airport while waiting to be collected. We did – it happened – time in which to reflect the flight.\n\nNight flight, darkness, quiet and little movement up-and-down the cabin makes for highly convenient air travel except … the economy seat was not particularly comfortable. It was small and narrow - with a short seat panel beneath your thighs and limited flexi-room from one side of the seat to the next. Not a seat in which to slump/sleep easily. And then there was the turbulence that started when crossing into Australian airspace – and remained for much of the flight.\n\nTullamarine Airport continued that sense of travelling without people - the terminal was empty. We were out-of-the plane and through the auto-immigration-check in 20 minutes. Long walking distances. Our luggage was on the carousel by the time we reached it. Amazing. Similarly, there was no queue backed-up at the customs authorities – hand over that declaration form and we were through. Half-hour from one seat to the next including a toilet stop? Coffee & croissant on a seat in Hudson’s Café never tasted better while we waited to be collected.\n\nPeter Steele\n22 September 2023\n\n*Singapore Airlines operate a fleet of >60 Airbus 350s with more on order. It’s currently the second largest commercial A350 fleet worldwide. They come in three configurations for medium haul, long haul and ultra-long haul. The longer the haul the fewer the passengers carried. Medium haul routes typically carry 300 passengers when full, two flight crew and cabin crew in the ratio one for every 50 passengers.\n",
                    "Recently used Singapore airlines, unfortunately flight from UK to Singapore was running 45 minutes late, we just made our onward flight from Singapore to Lombok. Service at Singapore was excellent.\nOur bags did not make the onward flight.\nThese things happen, however the service we then had was terrible, the customer service rep at Lombok was useless, we landed , were then informed that our cases were not on the flight, told we would get them three days later, ABI the service rep filled out the paperwork. Turns out he did not fill in the forms correctly, he did not give us a tracking number, he did not make copies, so waste of time as forms that were filled out he gave to us.\nWe then used Singapore airlines online/live chat to try and find out where our luggage was. They were very unresponsive as they did not have a lost luggage tracking number, I thought they could enter our luggage label number. \nTold me to go back to the airport, since this was nearly a two hour trip I declined.\nABi did not answer my texts to my Satisfaction, when cases did arrive at 1030 he said he had to Finnish his shift at 15.00 before sending them on.\nWhen he did send them on we had to pay for boat to bring cases over to island we were staying on, then pay the local taxi to bring them from the boat to the villa.\nThis could have been way more professional.\nFiling in form correctly so we had a valid code we could chase up.\nSingapore airlines being more helpful \nI don’t think we should have to pay to get our luggage delivered \nAnd just any type of communication with the airline/airport service rep, instead of ignoring the vast majority of my texts, NEVER answered the phone.\nCan’t wait to discuss this in person on my way back through Singapore ",

                    "My Briggs & Riley large suitcase was completely broken on the top and bottom. I have flown on 20 different airlines in the last 2 years with this lifetime-warranty bag, so they must have dropped it from the plane down to the tarmac or the like (as I once saw baggage handlers do on a different flight) or something equally damaging.  Infuriating.",
                    "To whom it may concerns,\n\nI flew with Singapore Airlines from 0814-0821 between BKK and SG. I can't believe in just one week Singapore Airline broke my luggage twice. Honestly I am still in shock. \n Singapore airline is globally renouned for its first-class service and during this trip I bought business class specifically just to experience it but got so disappointed in the end,\n\nOn 14-08-2022, I flew with SQ707 from Bangkok to Singapore for business. I landed just to found my luggage lost one wheel and its cover cracked in several places. I filed a complaint and the reference number is SINSQ52193. Since I don't have a usable luggage I had to be stuck in the same hotel for your staff to pick it up, fix and return it. I requested my luggage to be fixed at RIMOWA only but your staff said they can only ask their vendor to fix it. Since I only had one week in SG I said yes and they fixed & returned my luggage on 19-08-2022. The fixed wheel is different from the other three wheels and it looks a bit weird but I can live with it. \n\nI thought it's over, but On 22-08-2022, I flew back with SQ710 from Singapore to Bangkok. I landed and again found my luggage got crippled (one wheel hang loose to the case and it's not even the same one from last time). What's worse, the fixed wheel again got loose and a few more cracks was spotted on the cover. I had to file a complaint again and this time the reference number is BKKSQ37495.\n\nI attached all the damage photos for your reference. I also checked with RIMOWA China team and they replied it cannot be properly fixed. Even it does it's costly and  I can only use it for a quite short time. I will check with RIMOWA store in Thailand again. \n\nAt last, I have to say this is my worst flight ever. It's time-consuming, exhaustive and I have to re-schedule my plan since I don't have a usable luggage，and I have to buy a new suitcase to continue my trip. It ruined my trip completely and I really hope you guys can look into this and give me a solution. I‘ve try to sent 3 complain letters and instagrams ,NOBODY REPLY AND NOBODY CARES!THAT'S SO FUNNY AS A WORLD-WIDE 5STARS AIRLINES !!!",
                    "I was travel to Indonesia back in June this year, when I am back to Los Angeles, one of my Samsonite 28\" luggage full of my personal items was missing, on the same fright that  day, I also saw the other passenger also couldn't find their luggage.\nAfter several months back and ford, Singapore Airline inform me that they cannot locate my luggage and declare as lost, and want me to file a claim, when, where and how much the price,  I gave my list of items inside my luggage total around three thousand dollar. They said that I cannot put a luxury item inside my luggage and only want to settle with $1000. If I have know a couple hundred dollar is consider a luxury item, I will not put that item inside my luggage.\nWhoever read this review, please be informed next time when you travel. ",
                    "I flew business class on the SQ23 from NYC to Singapore on Jan 4th.  \nThe flight was OK. Singapore air are cheap on wifi offering in business class.  They need to learn from KLM/Delta/AirFrance classic hospitality.  As for food options, not impressed.  They don't offer salads and healthy snacks.  They are too fixated on offering large variety of alcohol liquors.  Again, they need to benchmark SKY TEAM for first class hospitality !!!\nThe nightmare started when I landed in Singapore.\nUpon arrival, my luggage did not arrive with me.  Upon checking with customer service at the airport, they indicated my luggage was not loaded on the plane in NYC.   They said, my luggage was forwarded to LA for next day delivery to Singapore - RED FLAG1.  WHY would sing air send it to LA when another flight from NYC will be departing the following day ??.  \nFor next 8 days, I daily called the airline to find out the status.  Please note, I was calling.  No one from sing air called me!.  I kept getting the same scripted answer.  We are searching for your luggage.  Finally, on day #9 my luggage arrived.  My suite case was filthy and destroyed.  It is like someone dragged along the runway for a long time.  The fabric was ripped in 5 spots.  Arm handle was broken.\nWhen I opened it, beside spoiled goods, I discovered several stolen xmas gift items.  \nI submitted a claim on Jan 14th for spoiled and stolen goods.  Till now, March 5th, I am still chasing Singapore airline for compensation with no light at the end of the tunnel.\nTo add insult to injury.  Singapore airline, reached out to me regarding the damaged suite case.  They said, my 27 inch Samsonite is a fake one - RED FLAG2.  Please note, I bought it from Macy's in the USA 20 months ago and only used it 3 times.  I replied to Singapore airline and indicated there must be miss understanding.  This is genuine.  But, they insisted it is a fake Samsonite.  I finally gave up and asked them to replace it with identical Fake one - they can buy it from Macy's online.  They said NO. They will either give me 180 SGD or American Tourister brand as a replacement.  \n\nKey takeaway from all of this.  Singapore Airline is a fake façade of customer focus and service.  Next time I will go back to fly SKY Team (KLM/ Delta / Air France).  They are first class airline with genuine customer service focus.  BTW,  I have never ever had this type of experience with them.",

No service orientation. SQ may be a good carrier if everything works out well, but they have no customer service if help is needed.

                    "This is the worst airline. They lost my baggage going to the Philippines and also coming back to New York. The difference is even after a week and a half they can’t find my baggage and have yet to reach out or compensate me for my missing item.DO NOT FLY SINGAPORE AIRLINES",
                    "My sharing was experienced last year, 2022.  I just got to busy when I arrived home last October 2022, but then, I feel that I have to be fair and share my gratitude for SAL event though my review is 3 months late.  So, bear with me and read so you can decide whether to fly Singapore airlines in your next travel or not.\nWe boarded for our trip from Cebu to Los Angeles, U.S.A last September 3, 2022.  We had to fly via Scoot airlines from Cebu to Singapore, where we had a lay over of about 2 hours before our departure for L.A on the same day via Singapore Airlines flight SQ038.  When we arrived L.A. at around 9:30 in the evening, we found out that 1 of our checked-in luggage was missing.  Accompanied by my L.A. based sister-in-law, we went to file an irregularity report in LAX because none from the Singapore airlines was around that late evening.  Honestly, it was such a disappointing feeling for a tourist to miss a luggage and not being able to speak personally with personnel from the airlines.  And upon arriving the place where we staying in California, I found out we had another issue with Singapore airlines.  One of my luggage got badly damaged and that it was impossible to be fixed.  We had to throw it away as it was useless already.  Since the luggage that had all of my clothing as well as most of my husband’s, we had to buy everything we needed especially that our tour includes places with different weather conditions.  We were to go to Temecula, where the heat wave was really mean.  And had to go to Oakley and San Francisco where the weather was cold especially for us, who are used to the tropical weather.  \nAt first, I was very much disappointed with Singapore airlines because there was no way for me to contact them from L.A.  I had to get help from a cousin who lives in Singapore to contact them.  I also got help from my brother-in-law, James, who works at LAX.  He found a way to relay my concern to SAL and to connect me with the said airlines.  It took several days for the airlines to locate my lost luggage, which was eventually found in Singapore.  I learned from my cousin that my lost luggage never got on board the flight I was in.  To cut the long story short, my lost luggage was delivered to my sister-in-law’s residence sometime on the 23rd day since our arrival.  Prior to that, I have been communicating with Leo of Singapore airlines.  He was the person who ensured that I get my luggage back, as well as, be compensated well for my damaged luggage.  Aside from my luggage returned and delivered to me, he promised me an extra check-in luggage with a weight of 32 kilos to be free of charged and that the airlines was going to compensate for my lost luggage and damaged suitcase when we fly back home.  \nI was flying back home on Oct. 10, 2022 via SQ 037 with my 3 children and we had free check-in luggage of 23kilos times 2 each passenger PLUS the bonus of 32 kilos that Leo promised me.  However, my to-be-checked in luggage reached 10 and all 10 exceeded the required 23 kilos weight.  So, I tried to pre-purchase extra baggage via online but failed.  I’ve contacted the same contact number I was using to contact Leo but then he was unavailable.  It was another guy who took the call.  I just forgot his name but he sounded Indian and I’d like to mention that he was quite unhelpful.  I am definitely not being racist but I wanted to share that I was one unhappy customer with how he communicated with me.  He doubted that I couldn’t purchase extra baggage online.  He thought that I was doing it the wrong way so I had to send him screenshots to prove to him that it was impossible.  Anyway, he only told me to take screenshots and if I could prove that it was impossible even though I was doing it correctly, then he would give me the discount for excess baggage.  But clearly, he doubted that I was doing it right.  He probably thought I was that incapable of using their website.  When I arrived the Singapore Airlines counter (in the airport) before my flight to check in, I was politely greeted by a guy named Brennon ( I hope I got the name right). When I told him that I was supposed to meet Leo, he asked me if I was “me” (he mentioned my complete name).  And then he smiled upon my approval, and mentioned that we spoke on the phone.  Just to clarify, Brennon is not the same guy I was speaking to regarding the excess baggage.  I actually saw the (Indian) guy in the other counter.  (If I remember it right, his name was Nash.)  Anyway, Brennon introduced me to the guy behind him in a suit and it was Leo.  I was super glad to see the smiling face of Leo.  A lady, whom I presume is a co-worker, handed me the cash settlement (for the lost baggage and damaged suitcase) and Release and Indemnity form that I needed to sign.  Leo made up for the hassles I’ve gone through BIG TIME.  He checked in all my 10 luggage at no extra cost.  (Remember, everything was over 23kilos each!), gave us (the whole family) free access to the Star Alliance Lounge, boarded with the business class (It’s always convenient to board ahead of the rest so you get to put your hand carried items on the cabin above you), seats in the forward seat zone for all 4 of us, and 3 of us were in the extra leg room seats (it was like seating in the Premium Economy or even better.  I only booked on economy class, just so you know).  And all these were for FREE!  I could not thank Leo enough for making up for everything.  When we were entering the boarding area, I could not help but be teary eyed for all the blessings that the Lord has bestowed upon me and my family.  It was a trip worth remembering!  We are all so glad to have flown via Singapore airlines.  Would love to travel again with them this year.  God bless Singapore Airlines!\nP.S.  The amount I received from the settlement?  It was an amount that I would always be grateful for.  😊",
                    "What a shame.\n\nDelayed baggage when I arrived at the Paris airport. The representative told me that it would be sent the next day.\n\nI arrived on Thursday evening and it is now Saturday evening and I have not seen my luggage. Neither received any calls from anyone.\n\nI dont know where is my lugagge and I am left waiting for it . \n\nEven low cost airline provide a better customer service support. I have no idea why it is cited as among the best airlines. It is not even Top 20 in my book.\n\nWas my first time flying with this airline and it will be the last.",
                    "Check-in staff did not know rules for carry-on liquids. She insisted we could only carry on a total of 100ml when the Singapore Airlines website clearly states 100ml maximum PER CONTAINER, with a total maximum of ONE LITRE. It wasn't a big deal - we just checked the bag in - but I find it concerning that  Singapore Airlines staff don't know their own rules and refuse to seek clarification when you question them. Maybe this is just the way of the world now. Maybe I'm just old.",
                    "Is there a score less than terrible? Currently traveling. Lost my bag. Was not put on my plane, it was sent to Narita and then to Montreal instead of Singapore. No updates over the past 6 days. Called customer service and lost baggage every day. Still to find someone in SIA who cares. Bag has now been in Montreal for 3 days without moving. I now enter into my second week traveling with no luggage, clothes, meds, supplies….\n\nFind it hard to believe they were voted best airline. I have had better experiences on EasyJet. I only know where my bag is as it has an AirTag in it. SIA has no idea where it is, even with me telling them. It has not moved for 3 days….no one cares\n\nHave asked for them just to send my bag home and I will get it there. But again no updates or action. I have asked what I can claim for my expenses….clothes luggage etc….but again they are quiet end will not confirm. \n\n#siadoesnotcare #wonderifsomeoneinsiawillevercallme #siayoucandobetter",

                    "This is our first time to travel for a long flight (14 hours direct) with 1 year old. Flight attendants were helpful and sometimes spoke to my kid when he was a bit cranky. Service was great as usual. I would definitely recommend SQ!",
                    "As usual, SQ service was excellent.  Crew were super friendly and super efficient.  The food was very good. Great entertainment options.  Nice complimentary wi-fi!",
                    "We traveled from LAX to SIN and then on to DVO on Scoot. We had an amazing experience and it was easy to see why SQ has been one of the best airlines in the world. \n\nThe Long-haul portions of our flight arrived ahead of schedule and the crew was amazing. Seating was spacious and comfortable and the food was delicious. Serving my children their food first was a very nice touch. \n\nWe look forward to the opportunity to fly SQ again in the future!",
                    "SQ feels like a 5 star airline if you are flying first or business class. But if you are in economy or premium economy, this is not the case. On a recent premium economy flight from SIN to SFO, I was reminded why SQ continues to fall behind many of its competitors. \n\nBiggest complaint is the food, particularly for long haul flights. Consistently poor quality and presentation. LH, BR, BA, SK, among others, serve an enhanced meal, service and cabin experience vs SQ to match the price difference that premium economy commands these days. For economy, food plus seats are the issue. While I was not in economy on this particular flight, the new seats on A350s (regional or long haul) are too narrow and hard. A big downgrade from SQ's older economy seats. ",
                    "I originally booked this return flight as being a 777, but they changed it to 350-900.  Not so nice. SQ238 outbound, then the two short flights to HCMC, return SQ227. \nUsed to get breakfast pre pandemic with this flight. Not any more.  SQ needs to realise the last memory of the flight is starving passengers who have to nick to Maccas on landing.  Not good enough. Not for a flight that cost thousands.  SQ was in the red now is in the black so it is time to bring back the service that SQ was famous for.  I think everyone on my flight was as bitterly disappointed as I was. I guess they are No 1 in first class, and have given up even trying to compete with business.  Maybe it is time to move on. I will look for the cheaper option next time as the best is no longer the best.",
                    "I usually fly SQ so that I can collect miles. I’m a PPS but since a while it’s impossible to redeem any ticket with your points. Not a chance. \nSo what’s the point to spend more money with SQ when Qatar airway and Emirates are cheaper and have excellent services? \nBefore the reason was the award tickets now it’s difficult to find a reason. Worst flyer program and most expensive for no benefit. Not worthy!",
                    "SQ korean ground crews at incheon are not efficient. Created a mess prior to boarding. They should annouce on the PA the rows to board first instead of having everyone clueless and join the queue and later being told to leave the queue until their rows are called. \n\nFood onboard is worst than army food. Flights never leave on time and always late on both flights to and from Korea. \n\nWill not choose SQ in future as i had better experience flying with other airlines like ANA or Korean Air.",
                    "I have flown on SQ many times over the years in both Economy and Business Class.\nWhat I experienced on my recent flights was that there was obvious cost cutting going on which is a shame as this is not reflected on the ticket price.\nNo longer is a welcome on board drink offered, amenity kits are only given if you ask and reduction in the food size and quality.\nI wont even start on the IFE offerings, luck I had my tablet and Netflix to fill the flight time in.\nThe lie flat beds are a good size but hard as a rock, no seat/bed covers provided like other premium carriers so I would not suggest flying long haul with them.",
                    "Flying with SQ is always a pleasure especially for long haul flights. They ensure that the plane is properly sanitized especially during this pandemic and they provided a sanitizing kit which has disinfecting wipes and mask. In-flight service is also efficient. Food could have been better. Overall, it was a good experience.",
                    "Been trying to contact them for some changes but its like talking to air. They are worse than a budget airlines. I am not sure as to why they are highly rated. There is something so wrong to all the airlines ranking.",
                    "Paid premium price for SQ (most expensive as compared to other international carriers) only to receive basic service. I think this is the only airline that does not allow us to choose our preferred seats in advance, well unless you wanna fork out extra money. *roll eyes* Got stuck in the middle seat of a full flight on the way back home, with the SAME TYPE of meat for our halal food option which is lamb. Whats worst is both of us do not eat lamb and we cant even specify this down when we were selecting our halal food requirement. Luckily the leading flight steward, Mr Cheong, was empathetic towards us and help us change to a seafood meal instead. He also came checking up on us every now and then to see if we were doing fine and accommodating to our every needs. Its nice to come back home to this kind of impeccable service... With that said, SQ has still so much to improve in terms of food quality (fish has some kind of smell, lamb was not cooked properly, pudding was not nice at all - better stick to ice creams) Only delicious thing was the Turkish baklava.\n\nOn another flight to Heathrow, my sister asked for seafood instant noodles but was also not provided. One of my friend did not get her Halal food even though she has already requested for this way in advance, reason because they had \"overlooked\" it and they do not have any extra to cater for her. Next time we will just stick with Emirates... well at least we have the option to choose a window seat without paying extra.",
                    "3 segments on SQ: ZRH-SIN-DPS and SIN-LHR (B777, B787 and A380). Very comfortable seats, friendly crew, great entertainment system, I've ordered vege-meals tasty and they were tasty and sufficient. Transit at SIN surprisingly a bit chaotic but the crowds were overwhelming. 9/10.",
                    "The writer often travels on the kangaroo route and occasionally on regional flights in South East Asia - mostly for business reasons. \n\nIn those years, SQ was in a league of their own. They had really delicious inflight meal, innovative entertainment System.. And lets not to forget the SIA girls in those day when they wholeheartedly served the guests with the highest standards ever seen- great care and high level of adaptability to the guests behaviours, and also their attention to details. \n\nFast forward to today, where should I start?\n\nSQ girls\n\nDownright rigid and robotic, like IATA police. Chaotic crew management. When it was 45 minutes before landing, the cabin crew already began to diligently enforce all passengers to draw the window shades open and put seat back upright. And they will go around checking with such great efficiency that would have made Hitler proud. One crew member even asked me to take off the sq earphones for landing, and the plane hasn't descended. Some crew in red kabaya were a few times seen to talk down loudly at the junior crew to get something done. Truly shocking for the passengers around. I still haven't even touched on the topic on the vast disparity in the way they treat passengers of different races. \n\nNow come on, why are we forced to be so uptight with following the IATA rules? What's worse - they enforce the rules like a policeman. One can easily get the impression that SQ is institutionalising their past best practises. Every moves of the sq girls are subjected to ISO9001 audit! I can reveal that the crew do this much differently on other competing 5 star airlines!\n\nInflight meal-- absolutely horrendous, especially economy class meals. Regional meals replaced with bento box meals? Sure, the porridge taste OK. But the pasta and chicken rice don't. Pasta and vege were often overcooked when served. Haagen Daaz ice cream are gone. The wines taste cheap. \n\nSeats-- seats definitely feel harder and less comfy. On the 380 and 777, the Y seats are fine. They feel reasonably wide enough. But beware of their 787 dreamliner. Their Y seats are incredibly narrow. Many friends and family members commented the same to me. \n\nInflight entertainment and WiFi\nDo not be fooled by their seemingly many choices on offer. The movie choices seem good, but many top-rated Hollywood movies and Netflix Shows are missing. OK, they try to make up for it by adding the krisflyer login and playlist option. Sounds like a nice touch, but if guests aren't looking forward to your entertainment options on offer, who will bother? Even kids movies feel cheap. And now SQ is trying to win back frequent flyers by offering unlimited WiFi only to krisflyer members registered on this flight, but not to passengers redeeming miles on other frequent flyer programs. Yikes! Sound like a trap. \n\nKrisflyer\nIn general, award space availability for kf members have fallen. It also costs more miles to fly the same route as compared to other competing airlines. One glaring example is on the Singapore-Sydney route. I will leave it to you to do the research on the mile redemption costs. \n\nOverall, you can feel that SQ management is tweaking around with the onboard and on-ground experience in the face of greater financial pressure and competition. The overall experience feels cheaper, manipulated, and less premium than before, and they no longer justify the high airfare traditionally quoted by SQ. Standards have fallen. Frequent flyers loyalty deserves better elsewhere.\n\nI am so glad that I switched my airlines loyalty. \n\nThe writer is a former PPS club member and former Krisflyer elite gold member, both membership of which have since expired. He is now proudly a gold member of 2 competing 5-star airlines which also flies to Singapore.",
                    "I was at the airport early. There was one counter for SIA open but they refused to check me in so that I had to wait for another 2 hours. The counter was only for Suites. That‘s a joke. SIA never again.",
                    "I went to Perth in June expecting another world class performance from sq but no it was quite the opposite.\nSo firstly the flight was delayed but at least we took off. The flight attendants on the flight were suprisingly horrible. All they said when I boarded was hi.  HI😳\nThe food in the flight was utterly disgusting. Rather poor by sq standards. The tray table wasn’t cleaned and the attendants literally ignored me. Sq world class service 😂😂😂 I had always liked sq but after the flight I wasn’t quite sure to fly sq ever again",
                    "I flew with SQ when I travelled to Istanbul and it was nice really nice for economy class. The flight itself was full of passengers but I can still enjoy the flight.",
                    "Disappointed with SQ ground service. I accidently left my water bottle at SQ 956 seat number 17A on August 2. I have reported the case directly online with case number SQFP030823039727 after several attempts to contact the SQ customer service LA/SING/JKT.\n\nToday August 12th, 10 days after, no one following up my case, no email, no phone call, no nothing!! what ashamed",
                    "Constant disappointment with SQ lately. Food is extremely bad, I fell sick after my last short flight to HK. Customer service and benefits for Krisflyer members are mediocre and the website is constantly failing. Not sure what they do with the money they charge cause their product quality has clearly dropped. \n\nNot what it used to be. Flying Japanese/Middle Eastern airlines moving forward.",
                    "Our past experiences with the airline was soog good that we just took it for granted it will always be excellent. But... competition from the Gulf states seesm to have made it tough for SQ to stay on top. Staff still perfect, but meals and snack available during a long flight ? hum... We'll fly again with SQ, but they need to improve (a bit)",
                    "Date - OCT 10th 2023\nFlight - SQ26\nI have travelled to over 40 countries.  I have flown on best and worst airlines in the world. My top airlines always been Emirates, Qatar, Etihad, Turkish, Thai, and Singapore.  But I have not flown with SQ for 5-6 years. They disappointed me on this  trip. Crappy food and OK service. What really happened? Did I missed anything?",
                    "Very bad expeirence for flight check in at baiyun airport! It took one hour plus to Q. Only 5 counters for economy class and 2 for business class. Lousy, no more SQ in my life!",
                    "My upgrade to business class due to a missed connection proves again that SQ is my favourite airline. The special treatment was very much appriciated.",
                    "I used to have an amazing impression of SQ, until now. I flew to Phuket from Singapore just last week. It was a total disappointment. The plane was small and don't have entertainment screen. The food was served in paper boxes. The only thing good was the service by the crew members. Why am I paying premium prices for a budget flight? The brand name of Singapore Airlines has totally gone down the drain after covid days.",
                    "I think SQ is the best. The crew is extremely friendly and kind. The food is delicious and the inflight system is good cuz there are so many movies from various cultures and a lot of movies for kids.",
                    "I used to think that SQ was the best, my how standards have fallen. I waited for over 2 hours in Melbourne Air while they figured out how to un-jam my seat (wheelchair).  I suspect this happened at SQ Air loading and instead of delivering my repaired chair  to the club, I waited in the check in area.  The flight itself was poor, I have experienced better flights in economy.  QF your many minor faults are forgiven!!!",
                    "I used to rave about the service of SQ, however my recent flight has left much regret, I should have chosen a different  airline. The stewardess & steward were  not so polite & not very patient. The airline doesn't live up to their good name, how disappointing!",
                    "Big thanks to the ground staff at the SQ check-in counter this morning. Apologies can’t remember their full names - but a very pleasant and professional team of two. Mr P and Ms T processed our check-in (SQ 725) with special attentiveness, warmth and friendliness….what refreshingly joyful service!  Thank you for the surprise upgrade too!",
                    "We were disappointed with the SQ for the following reasons:\n1.  No amenities kit for business class. One has to ask for each item ( socks, slippers, ear plugs, eyes mask, lotion……..) individually \n2.  Only two meals were offered on an 18 hours flight. The rest are only snacks for you to ask\n3.  Wi Fi were unstable on and off for the whole flight. It’s very frustrating to get any work done\n4.  Lie flat seat need flight attendant to help set up\n5.  The “chicken rice” meal I had was inedible. The meat was hard and dry. I guessed it’s because of being reheated too many time",
                    "SQ 215 \nWaited long for the food when I had a chance I was told that the one I wished to have was no longer available \nUnprofessional cabin crew blamed the supplier \nUnprofessional cabin chief offered the left over from business class \nFelt insulted \nNo official apology from him\nWorst example of customer service \nFood in this sector is becoming a joke \nThe original SQ has gone",
                    "Where can I start now… SQ has just dropped its standards when it comes to meals, drinks and onboard amenity kit. Only one meal on a 7.30 hour flight from SIN to SYD and no amenity kit on an overnight flight.\nYou get a dinner meal and that’s all you get. No breakfast, NO tea or coffee in the morning. The crew just take trays of water throughout the flight. Also the dinner is only 2 courses meal. Even Emirates is still serving 3 course in economy. Interesting that SYD to SIN sector you get two meals and more. Does SQ discriminate on who is flying onboard ? Qantas is providing 2 meals on SIN to SYD sectors.\nIt feels like SQ has cut down on many things and charging customer must higher fares for low quality product. \n\nSQ can't be considered as 5 star airline anymore. You might as well fly on Scoot for lower fare and pay for the meals. \n\nCrew and the aircraft are good but meal service is failing SQ.\n\nPlease restore your services to pre-covid times.",
                    "Unfortunately we had a very bad experience with SQ 208 (10th December 19.25 pm Flight from Melbourne) couple of crew members were very rude. We never had this experience before with Singapore air line totally disappointed. But we had a pleasant experience with SQ 468 15th December at22.10 from Singapore crew members were very supportive.",
                    "All good and the only drawback for SQ compare to other airlines is, SQ flight attendants seem to avoid cleaning of toilet. Less frequent and less thorough for sure compare to other major airlines.",

It aggregates metrics such as `avg_rating`, proportion of total reviews (`review_share`), percentage of negative reviews (`negative_pct`), and total `helpful_votes`. These metrics are then normalized using z-score transformation to ensure comparability. Finally, a weighted formula (50% z_severity, 30% z_negative_pct, 20% z_helpful) is applied to compute the final `impact_score`, helping identify the most critical pain points for Singapore Airlines to address.\n"

        "- Why: This topic now has the highest overall impact score (1.007). It also has the lowest average rating (1.35) and contributes to 28% of all reviews.\n",
        "- Evidence: It registers the highest severity index (0.204), a very high negative review rate (1,196%), and 1215 helpful votes, indicating that many customers found these complaints valuable.\n",
        "- Action: Prioritize process reengineering for refunds, improve escalation logic in support workflows, and offer proactive compensation options.\n",
        "# 2. Reconsider Inflight Experience for Economy Travelers\n",
        "- Why: This topic ranks second in impact and has an average rating of just 2.59, with a noticeable rise in negative sentiment post-2021.\n",
        "- Evidence: Despite a smaller share (2.5%), the impact score (0.407) is driven by a relatively high severity index and very high helpfulness feedback (1,983 votes).\n",
        "- Action: Introduce cabin layout trials, survey economy passengers regularly, and benchmark inflight comfort metrics against competitors.\n",
        "# 3. General Flight Experience Requires Attention\n",
        "- Why: While average rating (1.84) has declined, it holds the largest share of reviews (54%), suggesting widespread relevance.\n",
        "- Evidence: It shows ~1,119% negative rate post-2021 and received 379 helpful votes, although the impact score is moderate due to lower severity.\n",
        "- Action: Break this category into subcomponents (check-in, boarding, communication) and identify where breakdowns most affect perception.\n",
        "# 4. Address Lost or Mishandled Luggage Proactively\n",
        "- Why: Although previously seen as critical, it now ranks lower in overall impact.\n",
        "- Evidence: It has a lower volume (6%), high negative rate (1,200%), and modest helpful votes (242), resulting in an impact score of -0.25.\n",
        "- Action: Maintain existing interventions (tracking, claims automation), but shift focus to topics with greater system-wide impact unless volume increases again.\n",
        "# 5. Crew & Meal Quality May Be Overrepresented\n",
        "- Why: While once considered a visibility driver, the updated data suggests low impact, lowest severity, and minimal helpfulness signals.\n",
        "- Evidence: Impact score is lowest at -0.93, with only 2.5% review share and 101 helpful votes.\n",
        "- Action: Continue to monitor through feedback loops but deprioritize major investments here in the short term."
