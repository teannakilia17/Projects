# 📊 **Data Visualization Projects Overview**

## **Project: Coles Supermarket Sales Visualization**  

### Problem Statement:  
🏪💰 How does **store size** impact **sales** at Coles Supermarkets? The goal is to extract actionable insights for better store optimization and expansion decisions 🛒📈.

### Steps Taken:

1. **Data Preprocessing**:  
   - Cleaned the sales data (handled **missing values**) and removed outliers using `pandas` 🧹.
   - Applied **log transformation** to **normalize** skewed sales data (using `numpy` and `scipy`) 📉🔄.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
   - Created **boxplots**, **scatterplots**, and **bar graphs** to investigate the relationship between **store size** and **sales** 💡📊.
   - Identified **outliers** and **skewness** in the data and proposed **normalization** for more accurate insights 🎯.

3. **Results**:  
   - **Larger stores** generally made more money 💵, but **size alone** doesn't guarantee success 🏪❌.
   - Some **larger stores** underperformed, hinting at **operational inefficiencies** or **regional factors** 🌍🤔.

4. **Business Implications**:  
   - **Location-based strategies** are essential for optimizing store performance 📍🔧.
   - Coles should assess the **break-even size** for each store to avoid diminishing returns 🏙️📉.
