# 📊 **Data Visualization Projects Overview**

## 1️⃣ **Individual Project: Platform Economy – Uber & Lyft’s Exit Impact on Austin's Restaurants**

### Problem Statement:  
🚗💥 Uber and Lyft exit Austin, TX! We investigate the *ripple effects* on local restaurants using Yelp reviews and labor mobility data. How did this change affect **service** and **food quality**? 📉🍔

### Steps Taken:

1. **Data Preprocessing**:  
   - **Cleaned & merged** Yelp reviews and restaurant labor data (using `pandas` 🐼).
   - Split the data into **Austin** and **Dallas** for comparison. 🌎🔍

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
   - Created **visualizations** to understand Yelp review trends before & after Uber/Lyft exited using `matplotlib` and `seaborn` 🎨.
   - Used **time-series** analysis to track Yelp review counts (focused on food/service ratings) 🕒🍴.
   - Explored **labor mobility** to see how worker turnover (quit rates) was affected by the exit. 📊📈

3. **Results**:  
   - **Austin** saw **worse service and food reviews** during the ride-sharing exit period 📉🍴.
   - The absence of Uber and Lyft seemed to **boost competition for jobs**, leading to **higher turnover** but also **better service quality** temporarily 🏃‍♀️💼.

4. **Business Implications**:  
   - **Policymakers** should consider **indirect economic effects** of platform economy regulations 💡📜.
   - Food service businesses need to be ready for **workforce shifts** during such disruptions! 🏢🔄

## 2️⃣ **Group Project: Coles Supermarket Sales Visualization**  

### Problem Statement:  
🏪💰 How does **store size** impact **sales** at Coles Supermarkets? The goal is to extract actionable insights for better store optimization and expansion decisions 🛒📈.

### Steps Taken:

1. **Data Preprocessing**:  
   - Cleaned the sales data (handled **missing values**) and removed outliers using `pandas` 🧹.
   - Applied **log transformation** to **normalize** skewed sales data (using `numpy` and `scipy`) 📉🔄.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
   - Created **boxplots**, **scatterplots**, and **bar graphs** to investigate the relationship between **store size** and **sales** 💡📊.
   - Identified **outliers** and **skewness** in the data and proposed **normalization** for more accurate insights 🎯.

3. **Results**:  
   - **Larger stores** generally made more money 💵, but **size alone** doesn't guarantee success 🏪❌.
   - Some **larger stores** underperformed, hinting at **operational inefficiencies** or **regional factors** 🌍🤔.

4. **Business Implications**:  
   - **Location-based strategies** are essential for optimizing store performance 📍🔧.
   - Coles should assess the **break-even size** for each store to avoid diminishing returns 🏙️📉.
