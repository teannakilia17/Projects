Q1_2025,Colette Kress,"Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Simona. Q1 was another record quarter. Revenue of $26 billion was up 18% sequentially and up 262% year on year and well above our outlook of $24 billion. Starting with Data Center. Data Center revenue of $22.6 billion was a record, up 23% sequentially and up 427% year on year, driven by continued strong demand for the NVIDIA Hopper GPU computing platform. Compute revenue grew more than 5x and networking revenue more than 3x from last year. Strong sequential Data Center growth was driven by all customer types, led by enterprise and consumer Internet companies. Large cloud providers continue to drive strong growth as they deploy and ramp NVIDIA AI infrastructure at scale and represented the mid-40s as a percentage of our Data Center revenue. Training and inferencing AI on NVIDIA CUDA is driving meaningful acceleration in cloud rental revenue growth, delivering an immediate and strong return on cloud providers' investment. For every $1 spent on NVIDIA AI infrastructure, cloud providers have an opportunity to earn $5 in GPU instant hosting revenue over four years. NVIDIA's rich software stack and ecosystem and tight integration with cloud providers makes it easy for end customers up and running on NVIDIA GPU instances in the public cloud. For cloud rental customers, NVIDIA GPUs offer the best time-to-train models, the lowest cost to train models, and the lowest cost to inference large language models. For public cloud providers, NVIDIA brings customers to their cloud, driving revenue growth and returns on their infrastructure investments. Leading LLM companies such as OpenAI, Adept, Anthropic, Character.ai, Cohere, Databricks, DeepMind, Meta, Mistral, XAi, and many others are building on NVIDIA AI in the cloud. Enterprises drove strong sequential growth in Data Center this quarter. We supported Tesla's expansion of their training AI cluster to 35,000 H100 GPUs. Their use of NVIDIA AI infrastructure paved the way for the breakthrough performance of FSD version 12, their latest autonomous driving software based on Vision. NVIDIA Transformers, while consuming significantly more computing, are enabling dramatically better autonomous driving capabilities and propelling significant growth for NVIDIA AI infrastructure across the automotive industry. We expect automotive to be our largest enterprise vertical within Data Center this year, driving a multibillion revenue opportunity across on-prem and cloud consumption. Consumer Internet companies are also a strong growth vertical. A big highlight this quarter was Meta's announcement of Llama 3, their latest large language model, which was trained on a cluster of 24,000 H100 GPUs. Llama 3 powers Meta AI, a new AI assistant available on Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger. Llama 3 is openly available and has kick-started a wave of AI development across industries. As generative AI makes its way into more consumer Internet applications, we expect to see continued growth opportunities as inference scales both with model complexity as well as with the number of users and number of queries per user, driving much more demand for AI compute. In our trailing four quarters, we estimate that inference drove about 40% of our Data Center revenue. Both training and inference are growing significantly. Large clusters like the ones built by Meta and Tesla are examples of the essential infrastructure for AI production, what we refer to as AI factories. These next-generation data centers host advanced full-stack accelerated computing platforms where the data comes in and intelligence comes out. In Q1, we worked with over 100 customers building AI factories ranging in size from hundreds to tens of thousands of GPUs, with some reaching 100,000 GPUs. From a geographic perspective, Data Center revenue continues to diversify as countries around the world invest in sovereign AI. Sovereign AI refers to a nation's capabilities to produce artificial intelligence using its own infrastructure, data, workforce, and business networks. Nations are building up domestic computing capacity through various models. Some are procuring and operating sovereign AI clouds in collaboration with state-owned telecommunication providers or utilities. Others are sponsoring local cloud partners to provide a shared AI computing platform for public and private sector use. For example, Japan plans to invest more than $740 million in key digital infrastructure providers, including KDDI, Sakura Internet, and SoftBank to build out the nation's sovereign AI infrastructure. France-based Scaleway, a subsidiary of the Iliad Group, is building Europe's most powerful cloud-native AI supercomputer. In Italy, Swisscom Group will build the nation's first and most powerful NVIDIA DGX-powered supercomputer to develop the first LLM natively trained in the Italian language. And in Singapore, the National Supercomputer Centre is getting upgraded with NVIDIA Hopper GPUs, while Singtel is building NVIDIA's accelerated AI factories across Southeast Asia. NVIDIA's ability to offer end-to-end compute to networking technologies, full-stack software, AI expertise, and rich ecosystem of partners and customers allows sovereign AI and regional cloud providers to jump-start their country's AI ambitions. From nothing the previous year, we believe sovereign AI revenue can approach the high single-digit billions this year. The importance of AI has caught the attention of every nation. We ramped new products designed specifically for China that don't require export control license. Our Data Center revenue in China is down significantly from the level prior to the imposition of the new export control restrictions in October. We expect the market in China to remain very competitive going forward. From a product perspective, the vast majority of compute revenue was driven by our Hopper GPU architecture. Demand for Hopper during the quarter continues to increase. Thanks to CUDA algorithm innovations, we've been able to accelerate LLM inference on H100 by up to 3x, which can translate to a 3x cost reduction for serving popular models like Llama 3. We started sampling the H200 in Q1 and are currently in production with shipments on track for Q2. The first H200 system was delivered by Jensen to Sam Altman and the team at OpenAI and powered their amazing GPT-4o demos last week. H200 nearly doubles the inference performance of H100, delivering significant value for production deployments. For example, using Llama 3 with 700 billion parameters, a single NVIDIA HGX H200 server can deliver 24,000 tokens per second, supporting more than 2,400 users at the same time. That means for every $1 spent on NVIDIA HGX H200 servers at current prices per token, an API provider serving Llama 3 tokens can generate $7 in revenue over four years. With ongoing software optimizations, we continue to improve the performance of NVIDIA AI infrastructure for serving AI models. While supply for H100 grew, we are still constrained on H200. At the same time, Blackwell is in full production. We are working to bring up our system and cloud partners for global availability later this year. Demand for H200 and Blackwell is well ahead of supply, and we expect demand may exceed supply well into next year. Grace Hopper Superchip is shipping in volume. Last week at the International Supercomputing Conference, we announced that nine new supercomputers worldwide are using Grace Hopper for a combined 200 exaflops of energy-efficient AI processing power delivered this year. These include the Alps Supercomputer at the Swiss National Supercomputing Centre, the fastest AI supercomputer in Europe; Isambard-AI at the University of Bristol in the U.K.; and JUPITER in the Julich Supercomputing Centre in Germany. We are seeing an 80% attach rate of Grace Hopper in supercomputing due to its high energy efficiency and performance. We are also proud to see supercomputers powered with Grace Hopper take the No. 1, the No. 2, and the No. 3 spots of the most energy-efficient supercomputers in the world. Strong networking year-on-year growth was driven by InfiniBand. We experienced a modest sequential decline, which was largely due to the timing of supply, with demand well ahead of what we were able to ship. We expect networking to return to sequential growth in Q2. In the first quarter, we started shipping our new Spectrum-X Ethernet networking solution optimized for AI from the ground up. It includes our Spectrum-4 switch, BlueField-3 DPU, and new software technologies to overcome the challenges of AI on Ethernet to deliver 1.6x higher networking performance for AI processing compared with traditional Ethernet. Spectrum-X is ramping in volume with multiple customers, including a massive 100,000 GPU cluster. Spectrum-X opens a brand-new market to NVIDIA networking and enables Ethernet-only data centers to accommodate large-scale AI. We expect Spectrum-X to jump to a multibillion-dollar product line within a year. At GTC in March, we launched our next-generation AI factory platform, Blackwell. The Blackwell GPU architecture delivers up to 4x faster training and 30x faster inference than the H100 and enables real-time generative AI on trillion-parameter large language models. Blackwell is a giant leap with up to 25x lower TCO and energy consumption than Hopper. The Blackwell platform includes the fifth-generation NVLink with a multi-GPU spine and new InfiniBand and Ethernet switches, the X800 series designed for a trillion-parameter scale AI. Blackwell is designed to support data centers universally, from hyperscale to enterprise, training to inference, x86 to Grace CPUs, Ethernet to InfiniBand networking, and air cooling to liquid cooling. Blackwell will be available in over 100 OEM and ODM systems at launch, more than double the number of Hoppers launched and representing every major computer maker in the world. This will support fast and broad adoption across the customer types, workloads, and data center environments in the first-year shipments. Blackwell time-to-market customers include Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI, Oracle, Tesla, and XAi. We announced a new software product with the introduction of NVIDIA Inference Microservices, or NIM. NIM provides secure and performance-optimized containers powered by NVIDIA CUDA acceleration in network computing and inference software, including Triton and PrintServer, and TensorRT-LLM with industry-standard APIs for a broad range of use cases, including large language models for text, speech, imaging, vision, robotics, genomics, and digital biology. They enable developers to quickly build and deploy generative AI applications using leading models from NVIDIA, AI21, Adept, Cohere, Getty Images, and Shutterstock, and open models from Google, Hugging Face, Meta, Microsoft, Mistral AI, Snowflake, and Stability AI. NIMs will be offered as part of our NVIDIA AI enterprise software platform for production deployment in the cloud or on-prem. Moving to gaming and AI PCs. Gaming revenue of $2.65 billion was down 8% sequentially and up 18% year on year, consistent with our outlook for a seasonal decline. The GeForce RTX SUPER GPUs market reception is strong and end demand and channel inventory remained healthy across the product range. From the very start of our AI journey, we equipped GeForce RTX GPUs with CUDA Tensor cores. Now, with over 100 million of an installed base, GeForce RTX GPUs are perfect for gamers, creators, AI enthusiasts, and offer unmatched performance for running generative AI applications on PCs. NVIDIA has full technology stack for deploying and running fast and efficient generative AI inference on GeForce RTX PCs. TensorRT-LLM now accelerates Microsoft's Phi-3 Mini model and Google's Gemma 2B and 7B models as well as popular AI frameworks, including LangChain and LlamaIndex. Yesterday, NVIDIA and Microsoft announced AI performance optimizations for Windows to help run LLMs up to 3x faster on NVIDIA GeForce RTX AI PCs. And top game developers, including NetEase Games, Tencent, and Ubisoft are embracing NVIDIA Avatar Character Engine to create lifelike avatars to transform interactions between gamers and non-playable characters. Moving to ProViz, revenue of $427 million was down 8% sequentially and up 45% year on year. We believe generative AI and Omniverse industrial digitalization will drive the next wave of professional visualization growth. At GTC, we announced new Omniverse Cloud APIs to enable developers to integrate Omniverse industrial digital twin and simulation technologies into their applications. Some of the world's largest industrial software makers are adopting these APIs, including ANSYS, Cadence, 3DXCITE, Dassault Systems brand, and Siemens. And developers can use them to stream industrial digital twins with spatial computing devices such as Apple Vision Pro. Omniverse Cloud APIs will be available on Microsoft Azure later this year. Companies are using Omniverse to digitalize their workflows. Omniverse power digital twins enable Wistron, one of our manufacturing partners, to reduce end-to-end production cycle times by 50% and defect rates by 40%. And BYD, the world's largest electric vehicle maker, is adopting Omniverse for virtual factory planning and retail configurations. Moving to automotive. Revenue was $329 million, up 17% sequentially and up 11% year on year. Sequential growth was driven by the ramp of AI Cockpit solutions with global OEM customers and strength in our self-driving platforms. Year-on-year growth was driven primarily by self-driving. We supported Xiaomi in the successful launch of its first electric vehicle, the SU7 sedan built on the NVIDIA DRIVE Orin, our AI car computer for software-defined AV fleets. We also announced a number of new design wins on NVIDIA DRIVE Thor, the successor to Orin, powered by the new NVIDIA Blackwell architecture with several leading EV makers, including BYD, XPeng, GAC's Aion Hyper, and Nuro. DRIVE Thor is slated for production vehicles starting next year. OK, moving to the rest of the P&L. GAAP gross margin expanded sequentially to 78.4% and non-GAAP gross margins to 78.9% on lower inventory targets. As noted last quarter, both Q4 and Q1 benefited from favorable component costs. Sequentially, GAAP operating expenses were up 10% and non-GAAP operating expenses were up 13%, primarily reflecting higher compensation-related costs and increased compute and infrastructure investments. In Q1, we returned $7.8 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and cash dividends. Today, we announced a 10-for-1 split of our shares with June 10 as the first day of trading on a split-adjusted basis. We are also increasing our dividend by 150%. Let me turn to the outlook for the second quarter. Total revenue is expected to be $28 billion, plus or minus 2%. We expect sequential growth in all market platforms. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 74.8% and 75.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points, consistent with our discussion last quarter. For the full year, we expect gross margins to be in the mid-70s percent range. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $4 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively. Full-year opex is expected to grow in the low 40% range. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be an income of approximately $300 million, excluding gains and losses from nonaffiliated investments.GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 17%, plus or minus 1%, excluding any discrete items. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website.

Q1_2025,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Operating Officer,"Thanks, Colette. The industry is going through a major change. Before we start Q&A, let me give you some perspective on the importance of the transformation. The next industrial revolution has begun. Companies and countries are partnering with NVIDIA to shift the trillion-dollar installed base of traditional data centers to accelerated computing and build a new type of data center, AI factories, to produce a new commodity, artificial intelligence. AI will bring significant productivity gains to nearly every industry and help companies be more cost- and energy-efficient while expanding revenue opportunities. CSPs were the first generative AI movers. With NVIDIA, CSPs accelerated workloads to save money and power. The tokens generated by NVIDIA Hopper drive revenues for their AI services. And NVIDIA cloud instances attract rental customers from our rich ecosystem of developers. Strong and accelerating demand for generative AI training and inference on the Hopper platform propels our Data Center growth. Training continues to scale as models learn to be multimodal, understanding text, speech, images, video, and 3D and learn to reason and plan. Our inference workloads are growing incredibly. With generative AI, inference, which is now about fast token generation at massive scale, has become incredibly complex. Generative AI is driving a from-foundation-up full-stack computing platform shift that will transform every computer interaction. From today's information retrieval model, we are shifting to an answers and skills generation model of computing. AI will understand context and our intentions, be knowledgeable, reason, plan, and perform tasks. We are fundamentally changing how computing works and what computers can do, from general-purpose CPU to GPU accelerated computing, from instruction-driven software to intention-understanding models, from retrieving information to performing skills and, at the industrial level, from producing software to generating tokens, manufacturing digital intelligence. Token generation will drive a multiyear build-out of AI factories. Beyond cloud service providers, generative AI has expanded to consumer Internet companies and enterprise, sovereign AI, automotive, and healthcare customers, creating multiple multibillion-dollar vertical markets. The Blackwell platform is in full production and forms the foundation for trillion-parameter scale generative AI. The combination of Grace CPU, Blackwell GPUs, NVLink, Quantum, Spectrum, mix and switches, high-speed interconnects, and a rich ecosystem of software and partners let us expand and offer a richer and more complete solution for AI factories than previous generations. Spectrum-X opens a brand-new market for us to bring large-scale AI to Ethernet-only data centers. And NVIDIA NIMs is our new software offering that delivers enterprise-grade optimized generative AI to run on CUDA everywhere from the cloud to on-prem data centers, to RTX AI PCs through our expansive network of ecosystem partners. From Blackwell to Spectrum-X to NIMs, we are poised for the next wave of growth. Thank you.",neutral,0.758597374,Neutral,Slightly Positive,0.3,0.4,0.2,0.05,0.05,Strong Positive

Q1_2025,Tim Arcuri,UBS -- Analyst,"Thanks a lot. I wanted to ask, Jensen, about the deployment of Blackwell versus Hopper just given the system's nature and all the demand for GB that you have. How does the deployment of this stuff differ from Hopper? I guess I ask because liquid cooling at scale hasn't been done before, and there's some engineering challenges both at the node level and within the data center. So, do these complexities sort of elongate the transition? And how do you sort of think about how that's all going? Thanks.",neutral,0.90184027,Neutral,Neutral,0.05,0.1,0.7,0.1,0.05,Neutral
Q1_2025,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Operating Officer,"Yep. Blackwell comes in many configurations. Blackwell is a platform, not a GPU. And the platform includes support for air-cooled, liquid-cooled, x86 and Grace, InfiniBand, now Spectrum-X, and very large NVLink domain that I demonstrated at GTC -- that I showed at GTC. And so, for some customers, they will ramp into their existing installed base of data centers that are already shipping Hoppers. They will easily transition from H100 to H200 to B100. And so, Blackwell systems have been designed to be backwards compatible, if you will, electrically, mechanically. And of course, the software stack that runs on Hopper will run fantastically on Blackwell. We also have been priming the pump, if you will, with the entire ecosystem, getting them ready for liquid cooling. We've been talking to the ecosystem about Blackwell for quite some time. And the CSPs, the data centers, the ODMs, the system makers, our supply chain; beyond them, the cooling supply chain base, liquid cooling supply chain base, data center supply chain base, no one is going to be surprised with Blackwell coming and the capabilities that we would like to deliver with Grace Blackwell 200.

Jensen, how are you ensuring that there is enough utilization of your products and that there isn't a pull ahead or a holding behavior because of tight supply, competition, or other factors? Basically, what checks have you built in the system to give us confidence that monetization is keeping pace with your really very strong shipment growth?",neutral,0.722222924,Neutral,Neutral,0.05,0.1,0.7,0.1,0.05,Neutral
Q1_2025,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Operating Officer,"Well, I guess there's the big picture view that I'll come to, but I'll answer your question directly. The demand for GPUs in all the data centers is incredible. We're racing every single day. And the reason for that is because applications like ChatGPT and GPT-4o, and now, it's going to be multi-modality, Gemini and its ramp and Anthropic, and all of the work that's being done at all the CSPs are consuming every GPU that's out there. There's also a long line of generative AI start-ups, some 15,000, 20,000 start-ups that are in all different fields, from multimedia to digital characters, of course, all kinds of design tool application, productivity applications, digital biology, the moving of the AV industry to video so that they can train end-to-end models to expand the operating domain of self-driving cars, the list is just quite extraordinary. We're racing actually. Customers are putting a lot of pressure on us to deliver the systems and stand those up as quickly as possible. And of course, I haven't even mentioned all of the sovereign AIs who would like to train all of their regional natural resource of their country, which is their data, to train their regional models. And there's a lot of pressure to stand those systems up. So, anyhow, the demand, I think, is really, really high and it outstrips our supply. That's the reason why I jumped in to make a few comments. Longer term, we're completely redesigning how computers work. And this is a platform shift. Of course, it's been compared to other platform shifts in the past. But time will clearly tell that this is much, much more profound than previous platform shifts. And the reason for that is because the computer is no longer an instruction-driven-only computer. It's an intention-understanding computer. And it understands, of course, the way we interact with it, but it also understands our meaning, what we intend that we asked it to do. And it has the ability to reason, inference iteratively to process a plan, and come back with a solution. And so, every aspect of the computer is changing in such a way that instead of retrieving prerecorded files, it is now generating contextually relevant intelligent answers. And so, that's going to change computing stacks all over the world. And you saw a build that, in fact, even the PC computing stack is going to get revolutionized. And this is just the beginning of all the things that -- what people see today are the beginning of the things that we're working in our labs and the things that we're doing with all the start-ups and large companies and developers all over the world. It's going to be quite extraordinary. Operator Our next question will come from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.

Q1_2025,Joe Moore,Morgan Stanley -- Analyst,"Great. Thank you. Understanding what you just said about how strong demand is, you have a lot of demand for H200 and for Blackwell products. Do you anticipate any kind of pause with Hopper and H100 as you sort of migrate to those products? Will people wait for those new products, which would be a good product to have?

Q1_2025,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Operating Officer,"We see increasing demand of Hopper through this quarter. And we expect demand to outstrip supply for some time as we now transition to H200, as we transition to Blackwell. Everybody is anxious to get their infrastructure online. And the reason for that is because they're saving money and making money, and they would like to do that as soon as possible.

Q1_2025,Toshiya Hari,Goldman Sachs -- Analyst,"Hi. Thank you so much for taking the question. Jensen, I wanted to ask about competition. I think many of your cloud customers have announced new or updates to their existing internal programs, right, in parallel to what they're working on with you guys. To what extent did you consider them as competitors, medium to long term? And in your view, do you think they're limited to addressing mostly internal workloads, or could they be broader in what they address going forward? Thank you.",neutral,0.871607423,Neutral,Neutral,0.05,0.1,0.7,0.1,0.05,Neutral
Q1_2025,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Operating Officer,"Yeah. We're different in several ways. First, NVIDIA's accelerated computing architecture allows customers to process every aspect of their pipeline from unstructured data processing to prepare it for training, to structured data processing, data frame processing like SQL to prepare for training, to training to inference. And as I was mentioning in my remarks, that inference has really fundamentally changed, it's now generation. It's not trying to just detect the cat, which was plenty hard in itself, but it has to generate every pixel of a cat. And so, the generation process is a fundamentally different processing architecture. And it's one of the reasons why TensorRT-LLM was so well received. We improved the performance in using the same chips on our architecture by a factor of three. That kind of tells you something about the richness of our architecture and the richness of our software. So, one, you could use NVIDIA for everything, from computer vision to image processing, to computer graphics, to all modalities of computing. And as the world is now suffering from computing cost and computing energy inflation because general-purpose computing has run its course, accelerated computing is really the sustainable way of going forward. So, accelerated computing is how you're going to save money in computing, is how you're going to save energy in computing. And so, the versatility of our platform results in the lowest TCO for their data centers. Second, we're in every cloud. And so, for developers that are looking for a platform to develop on, starting with NVIDIA is always a great choice. And we're on-prem. We're in the cloud. We're in computers of any size and shape. We're practically everywhere. And so, that's the second reason. The third reason has to do with the fact that we build AI factories. And this is becoming more apparent to people that AI is not a chip problem only. It starts, of course, with very good chips and we build a whole bunch of chips for our AI factories, but it's a systems problem. In fact, even AI is now a systems problem. It's not just one large language model. It's a complex system of a whole bunch of large language models that are working together. And so, the fact that NVIDIA builds this system causes us to optimize all of our chips to work together as a system, to be able to have software that operates as a system, and to be able to optimize across the system. And just to put it in perspective, in simple numbers, if you had a $5 billion infrastructure and you improved the performance by a factor of two, which we routinely do, when you improve the infrastructure by a factor of two, the value to you is $5 billion. All the chips in that data center doesn't pay for it. And so, the value of it is really quite extraordinary. And this is the reason why today, performance matters in everything. This is at a time when the highest performance is also the lowest cost because the infrastructure cost of carrying all of these chips cost a lot of money. And it takes a lot of money to fund the data center, to operate the data center, the people that goes along with it, the power that goes along with it, the real estate that goes along with it, and all of it adds up. And so, the highest performance is also the lowest TCO. Operator Our next question will come from the line of Matt Ramsay with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.",neutral,0.888682306,Neutral,Slightly Positive,0.2,0.4,0.3,0.05,0.05,Strong Positive
Q1_2025,Matt Ramsay,TD Cowen -- Analyst,"Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone. Jensen, I've been in the data center industry my whole career. I've never seen the velocity that you guys are introducing new platforms at the same combination of the performance jumps that you're getting, I mean, 5x in training, some of the stuff you talked about at GTC up to 30x in inference. And it's an amazing thing to watch but it also creates an interesting juxtaposition where the current generation of product that your customers are spending billions of dollars on is going to be not as competitive with your new stuff very, very much more quickly than the depreciation cycle of that product. So, I'd like you to, if you wouldn't mind, speak a little bit about how you're seeing that situation evolve itself with customers. As you move to Blackwell, they're going to have very large installed bases, obviously software compatible, but large installed bases of product that's not nearly as performant as your new generation stuff. And it'd be interesting to hear what you see happening with customers along that path. Thank you.",neutral,0.818970323,Neutral,Neutral,0.05,0.1,0.7,0.1,0.05,Neutral
Q1_2025,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Operating Officer,"Yeah, really appreciate it. Three points that I'd like to make. If you're 5% into the build-out versus if you're 95% into the build-out, you're going to feel very differently. And because you're only 5% into the build-out anyhow, you build as fast as you can. And when Blackwell comes, it's going to be terrific. And then after Blackwell, as you mentioned, we have other Blackwells coming. And then there's a short -- we're in a one-year rhythm as we've explained to the world. And we want our customers to see our road map for as far as they like, but they're early in their build-out anyways and so they had to just keep on building, OK? And so, there's going to be a whole bunch of chips coming at them, and they just got to keep on building and just, if you will, performance-average your way into it. So, that's the smart thing to do. They need to make money today. They want to save money today. And time is really, really valuable to them. Let me give you an example of time being really valuable, why this idea of standing up a data center instantaneously is so valuable, and getting this thing called time-to-train is so valuable. The reason for that is because the next company who reaches the next major plateau gets to announce a groundbreaking AI. And the second one after that gets to announce something that's 0.3% better. And so, the question is, do you want to be repeatedly the company delivering groundbreaking AI or the company delivering 0.3% better? And that's the reason why this race, as in all technology races, the race is so important. And you're seeing this race across multiple companies because this is so vital to have technology leadership, for companies to trust the leadership that want to build on your platform and know that the platform that they're building on is going to get better and better. And so, leadership matters a great deal. Time-to-train matters a great deal. The difference between time-to-train that is three months earlier just to get it done, in order to get time-to-train on three months' project, getting started three months earlier is everything. And so, it's the reason why we're standing up Hopper systems like mad right now because the next plateau is just around the corner. And so, that's the second reason. The first comment that you made is really a great comment, which is how is it that we're moving so fast and advancing them quickly, because we have all the stacks here. We literally build the entire data center, and we can monitor everything, measure everything, optimize across everything. We know where all the bottlenecks are. We're not guessing about it. We're not putting up PowerPoint slides that look good. We're actually -- we also like our PowerPoint slides to look good, but we're delivering systems that perform at scale. And the reason why we know they perform at scale is because we built it all here. Now, one of the things that we do that's a bit of a miracle is that we build entire AI infrastructure here but then we disaggregate it and integrate it into our customers' data centers however they liked. But we know how it's going to perform, and we know where the bottlenecks are. We know where we need to optimize with them, and we know where we have to help them improve their infrastructure to achieve the most performance. This deep intimate knowledge at the entire data center scale is fundamentally what sets us apart today. We build every single chip from the ground up. We know exactly how processing is done across the entire system. And so, we understand exactly how it's going to perform and how to get the most out of it with every single generation. So, I appreciate it. Those are the three points. Operator Your next question will come from the line of Mark Lipacis with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.",neutral,0.908484221,Neutral,Slightly Positive,0.2,0.4,0.3,0.05,0.05,Strong Positive
Q1_2025,Mark Lipacis,Evercore ISI -- Analyst,"Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Jensen, in the past, you've made the observation that general-purpose computing ecosystems typically dominated each computing era. And I believe the argument was that they could adapt to different workloads, get higher utilization, drive cost of compute cycle down. And this is a motivation for why you were driving to a general-purpose GPU CUDA ecosystem for accelerated computing. And if I mischaracterized that observation, please do let me know. So, the question is, given that the workloads that are driving demand for your solutions are being driven by neural network training and inferencing, which on the surface seem like a limited number of workloads, then it might also seem to lend themselves to custom solutions. And so, then the question is, does the general-purpose computing framework become more at risk or is there enough variability or a rapid enough evolution on these workloads that support that historical general-purpose framework? Thank you.",neutral,0.776361108,Neutral,Neutral,0.05,0.1,0.7,0.1,0.05,Neutral
Q1_2025,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Operating Officer,"Yeah. NVIDIA's accelerated computing is versatile, but I wouldn't call it general purpose. Like, for example, we wouldn't be very good at running the spreadsheet. That was really designed for general-purpose computing. And so, the control loop of an operating system code probably isn't fantastic for general-purpose computing, not for accelerated computing. And so, I would say that we're versatile, and that's usually the way I describe it. There's a rich domain of applications that we're able to accelerate over the years, but they all have a lot of commonalities, maybe some deep differences, but commonalities. They're all things that I can run in parallel, they're all heavily threaded. 5% of the code represents 99% of the run time, for example. Those are all properties of accelerated computing. The versatility of our platform and the fact that we design entire systems is the reason why over the course of the last 10 years or so, the number of start-ups that you guys have asked me about in these conference calls is fairly large. And every single one of them, because of the brittleness of their architecture, the moment generative AI came along or the moment the fusion models came along, the moment the next models are coming along now, and now all of a sudden, look at this, large language models with memory because the large language model needs to have memory so they can carry on a conversation with you, understand the context. All of a sudden, the versatility of the Grace memory became super important. And so, each one of these advances in generative AI and the advancement of AI really begs for not having a widget that's designed for one model but to have something that is really good for this entire domain, properties of this entire domain, but obeys the first principles of software: that software is going to continue to evolve, that software is going to keep getting better and bigger. We believe in the scaling of these models. There's a lot of reasons why we're going to scale by easily 1 million times in the coming few years for good reasons, and we're looking forward to it, and we're ready for it. And so, the versatility of our platform is really quite key. And if you're too brittle and too specific, you might as well just build an FPGA or you build an ASIC or something like that, but that's hardly a computer.

Q1_2025,Blayne Curtis,Jefferies -- Analyst,"Thanks for taking my question. I'm actually kind of curious, I mean, being supply constrained, how do you think about -- I mean, you came out with a product for China, H20. I'm assuming there'd be a ton of demand for it, but obviously, you're trying to serve your customers with the other Hopper products.

Q1_2025,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Operating Officer,"Well, you know, we have customers that we honor and we do our best for every customer. It is the case that our business in China is substantially lower than the levels of the past. And it's a lot more competitive in China now because of the limitations on our technology. And so, those matters are true. However, we continue to do our best to serve the customers in the markets there, and to the best of our ability, we'll do our best. But I think overall, the comments that we made about demand outstripping supply is for the entire market and particularly so for H200 and Blackwell toward the end of the year. Operator Our next question will come from the line of Srini Pajjuri with Raymond James. Please go ahead.",neutral,0.458708405,Neutral,Neutral,0.05,0.1,0.7,0.1,0.05,Slightly Positive
Q1_2025,Srini Pajjuri,Raymond James -- Analyst,"Thank you. Jensen, actually more of a clarification on what you said. GB200 systems, it looks like there is a significant demand for systems. Historically, I think you've sold a lot of HGX boards and some GPUs and the systems business was relatively small. So, I'm just curious, why is it that now you are seeing such a strong demand for systems going forward? Is it just the TCO, or is it something else? Or is it just the architecture? Thank you.",neutral,0.871153712,Neutral,Neutral,0.05,0.1,0.7,0.1,0.05,Slightly Positive
Q1_2025,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Operating Officer,"Yeah. I appreciate that. In fact, the way we sell GB200 is the same. We disaggregate all of the components that make sense, and we integrate it into computer makers. We have 100 different computer system configurations that are coming this year for Blackwell. And that is off the charts. Hopper, frankly, had only half, but that's at its peak. It started out with way less than that even. And so, you're going to see liquid-cooled version, air-cooled version, x86 versions, Grace versions, so on and so forth. There's a whole bunch of systems that are being designed. And they're offered from all of our ecosystem of great partners. Nothing has really changed. Now, of course, the Blackwell platform has expanded our offering tremendously, the integration of CPUs, and the much more compressed density of computing. Liquid cooling is going to save data centers a lot of money in provisioning power and not to mention to be more energy efficient. And so, it's a much better solution. It's more expansive, meaning that we offer a lot more components of a data center. And everybody wins. The data center gets much higher performance, networking from networking switches, networking -- of course, NICs. We have Ethernet now so that we can bring AI to a large-scale NVIDIA AI to customers who only know how to operate Ethernet because of the ecosystem that they have. And so, Blackwell is much more expansive. We have a lot more to offer our customers this generation around. Operator Our next question will come from the line William Stein with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.",neutral,0.905732274,Neutral,Slightly Positive,0.2,0.4,0.3,0.05,0.05,Slightly Positive
Q1_2025,William Stein,Truist Securities -- Analyst,"Great. Thanks for taking my question. Jensen, at some point, NVIDIA decided that while there were reasonably good CPUs available for data center operations, your ARM-based Grace CPU provides some real advantage that made that technology worth to bring to customers, perhaps related to cost or power consumption or technical synergies between Grace and Hopper or Grace and Blackwell. Can you address whether there could be a similar dynamic that might emerge on the client side whereby, while there are very good solutions, you've highlighted that Intel and AMD are very good partners and deliver great products in x86, but there might be some, especially in emerging AI workloads, advantage that NVIDIA can deliver that others have more of a challenge?",positive,0.763746917,Slightly Positive,Neutral,0.05,0.1,0.7,0.1,0.05,Slightly Positive
Q1_2025,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Operating Officer,"Well, you mentioned some really good reasons. It is true that for many of the applications, our partnership with x86 partners are really terrific and we build excellent systems together. But Grace allows us to do something that isn't possible with the configuration, the system configuration today. The memory system between Grace and Hopper are coherent and connected. The interconnect between the two chips -- calling it two chips is almost weird because it's like a superchip. The two of them are connected with this interface that's like at terabytes per second. It's off the charts. And the memory that's used by Grace is LPDDR. It's the first data center-grade low-power memory. And so, we save a lot of power on every single node. And then finally, because of the architecture, because we can create our own architecture with the entire system now, we could create something that has a really large NVLink domain, which is vitally important to the next-generation large language models for inferencing. And so, you saw that GB200 has a 72-node NVLink domain. That's like 72 Blackwells connected together into one giant GPU. And so, we needed Grace Blackwells to be able to do that. And so, there are architectural reasons, there are software programming reasons and then there are system reasons that are essential for us to build them that way. And so, if we see opportunities like that, we'll explore it. And today, as you saw at the build yesterday, which I thought was really excellent, Satya announced the next-generation PCs, Copilot+ PC, which runs fantastically on NVIDIA's RTX GPUs that are shipping in laptops. But it also supports ARM beautifully. And so, it opens up opportunities for system innovation even for PCs. Operator Our last question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.",neutral,0.896387815,Neutral,Slightly Positive,0.2,0.4,0.3,0.05,0.05,Strong Positive
Q1_2025,C.J. Muse,Cantor Fitzgerald -- Analyst,"And amid rising potential competition from GPUs and custom ASICs, how are you thinking about NVIDIA's pace of innovation? And your million-fold scaling over the last decade, truly impressive, CUDA, precision, Grace, Cohere, and connectivity. When you look forward, what frictions need to be solved in the coming decade? And I guess maybe more importantly, what are you willing to share with us today?",neutral,0.805699527,Neutral,Neutral,0.05,0.1,0.7,0.1,0.05,Neutral
Q1_2025,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Operating Officer,"Well, I can announce that after Blackwell, there's another chip. And we are on a one-year rhythm. And you can also count on us having new networking technology on a very fast rhythm. We're announcing Spectrum-X for Ethernet. But we're all in on Ethernet, and we have a really exciting road map coming for Ethernet. We have a rich ecosystem of partners. Dell announced that they're taking Spectrum-X to market. We have a rich ecosystem of customers and partners who are going to announce taking our entire AI factory architecture to market. And so, for companies that want the ultimate performance, we have InfiniBand computing fabric. InfiniBand is a computing fabric, Ethernet to network. And InfiniBand, over the years, started out as a computing fabric, became a better and better network. Ethernet is a network and with Spectrum-X, we're going to make it a much better computing fabric. And we're committed, fully committed, to all three links, NVLink computing fabric for single computing domain, to InfiniBand computing fabric, to Ethernet networking computing fabric. And so, we're going to take all three of them forward at a very fast clip. And so, you're going to see new switches coming, new NICs coming, new capability, new software stacks that run on all three of them. New CPUs, new GPUs, new networking NICs, new switches, a mound of chips that are coming. And all of it -- the beautiful thing is all of it runs CUDA. And all of it runs our entire software stack. So, if you invest today on our software stack, without doing anything at all, it's just going to get faster and faster and faster. And if you invest in our architecture today, without doing anything, it will go to more and more clouds and more and more data centers, and everything just runs. And so, I think the pace of innovation that we're bringing will drive up the capability, on the one hand, and drive down the TCO on the other hand. And so, we should be able to scale out with the NVIDIA architecture for this new era of computing and start this new industrial revolution where we manufacture not just software anymore, but we manufacture artificial intelligence tokens, and we're going to do that at scale.

Q2_2025,Colette M. Kress,"Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President","Thanks, Stewart. Q2 was another record quarter. Revenue of $30 billion was up 15% sequentially and up 122% year on year and well above our outlook of $28 billion. Starting with Data Center. Data Center revenue of $26.3 billion was a record, up 16% sequentially and up 154% year on year, driven by strong demand for NVIDIA Hopper, GPU computing, and our networking platforms. Compute revenue grew more than 2.5x. Networking revenue grew more than 2x from the last year. Cloud service providers represented roughly 45% of our Data Center revenue, and more than 50% stemmed from the consumer Internet and enterprise companies. Customers continue to accelerate their Hopper architecture purchases while gearing up to adopt Blackwell. Key workloads driving our Data Center growth include generative AI model training and inferencing; video, image, and text data pre and post processing with CUDA and AI workloads; synthetic data generation; AI-powered recommender systems; SQL and Vector database processing as well. Next-generation models will require 10 to 20 times more compute to train with significantly more data. The trend is expected to continue. Over the trailing four quarters, we estimate that inference drove more than 40% of our Data Center revenue. CSPs, consumer Internet companies, and enterprises benefit from the incredible throughput and efficiency of NVIDIA's inference platform. Demand for NVIDIA is coming from frontier model makers, consumer Internet services, and tens of thousands of companies and start-ups building generative AI applications for consumers, advertising, education, enterprise and healthcare, and robotics. Developers desire NVIDIA's rich ecosystem and availability in every cloud. CSPs appreciate the broad adoption of NVIDIA and are growing their NVIDIA capacity given the high demand. NVIDIA H200 platform began ramping in Q2, shipping to large CSPs, consumer Internet, and enterprise company. The NVIDIA H200 builds upon the strength of our Hopper architecture and offering over 40% more memory bandwidth compared to the H100. Our Data Center revenue in China grew sequentially in Q2 and a significant contributor to our Data Center revenue. As a percentage of total Data Center revenue, it remains below levels seen prior to the imposition of export controls. We continue to expect the China market to be very competitive going forward. The latest round of MLPerf inference benchmarks highlighted NVIDIA's inference leadership with both NVIDIA Hopper and Blackwell platform combining to win gold medals on all tasks. At Computex, NVIDIA, with the top computer manufacturers, unveiled an array of Blackwell architecture-powered systems and NVIDIA networking for building AI factories and data centers. With the NVIDIA MGX modular reference architecture, our OEMs and ODM partners are building more than 100 Blackwell-based systems designed quickly and cost-effectively. The NVIDIA Blackwell platform brings together multiple GPU, CPU, DPU, NVLink, and Link Switch and the networking chips, systems, and NVIDIA CUDA software to power the next generation of AI across the cases, industries, and countries. The NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 system with the fifth-generation NVLink enables all 72 GPUs to act as a single GPU and deliver up to 30x faster inference for LLM's workloads and unlocking the ability to run trillion-parameter models in real time. Hopper demand is strong, and Blackwell is widely sampling. We executed a change to the Blackwell GPU mass to improve production yields. Blackwell production ramp is scheduled to begin in the fourth quarter and continue into fiscal year '26. In Q4, we expect to get several billion dollars in Blackwell revenue. Hopper shipments are expected to increase in the second half of fiscal 2025. Hopper supply and availability have improved. Demand for Blackwell platforms is well above supply, and we expect this to continue into next year. Networking revenue increased 16% sequentially. Our Ethernet for AI revenue, which includes our Spectrum-X end-to-end Ethernet platform, doubled sequentially with hundreds of customers adopting our Ethernet offerings. Spectrum-X has broad market support from OEM and ODM partners and is being adopted by CSPs, GPU cloud providers, and enterprises, including xAI to connect the largest GPU compute cluster in the world. Spectrum-X supercharges Ethernet for AI processing and delivers 1.6x the performance of traditional Ethernet. We plan to launch new Spectrum-X products every year to support demand for scaling compute clusters from tens of thousands of GPUs today to millions of DPUs in the near future. Spectrum-X is well on track to begin a multibillion-dollar product line within a year. Our sovereign AI opportunities continue to expand as countries recognize AI expertise and infrastructure at national imperatives for their society and industries. Japan's National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology is building its AI Bridging Cloud Infrastructure 3.0 supercomputer with NVIDIA. We believe sovereign AI revenue will reach low double-digit billions this year. The enterprise AI wave has started. Enterprises also drove sequential revenue growth in the quarter. We are working with most of the Fortune 100 companies on AI initiatives across industries and geographies. A range of applications are fueling our growth, including AI-powered chatbots, generative AI copilots, and agents to build new monetizable business applications and enhance employee productivity. Amdocs is using NVIDIA generative AI for their smart agent, transforming the customer experience and reducing customer service costs by 30%. ServiceNow is using NVIDIA for its Now Assist offering, the fastest-growing new product in the company's history. SAP is using NVIDIA to build dual copilots. Cohesity is using NVIDIA to build their generative AI agent and lower generative AI development costs. Snowflake, serves over 3 billion queries a day for over 10,000 enterprise customers, is working with NVIDIA to build copilots. And lastly, is using NVIDIA AI Omniverse to reduce end-to-end cycle times for their factories by 50%. Automotive was a key growth driver for the quarter as every automaker developing autonomous vehicle technology is using NVIDIA in their data centers. Automotive will drive multibillion dollars in revenue across on-prem and cloud consumption and will grow as next-generation AV models require significantly more compute. Health care is also on its way to being a multibillion-dollar business as AI revolutionizes medical imaging, surgical robots, patient care, electronic health record processing, and drug discovery. During the quarter, we announced a new NVIDIA AI foundry service to supercharge generative AI for the world's enterprises with Meta's Llama 3.1 collection of models. This marks a watershed moment for enterprise AI. Companies for the first time can leverage the capabilities of an open-source frontier-level model to develop customized AI applications to encode their institutional knowledge into an AI flywheel to automate and accelerate their business. Accenture is the first to adopt the new service to build custom Llama 3.1 models for both its own use and to assist clients seeking to deploy generative AI applications. NVIDIA NIMs accelerate and simplify model deployment. Companies across healthcare, energy, financial services, retail, transportation, and telecommunications are adopting NIMs, including Aramco, Lowes, and Uber. AT&T realized 70% cost savings and eight times latency reduction after moving into NIMs for generative AI, call transcription, and classification. Over 150 partners are embedding NIMs across every layer of the AI ecosystem. We announced NIM Agent Blueprint, a catalog of customizable reference applications that include a full suite of software for building and deploying enterprise generative AI applications. With NIM Agent Blueprint, enterprises can refine their AI applications over time, creating a data-driven AI flywheel. The first NIM Agent Blueprints include workloads for customer service, computer-aided drug discovery, and enterprise retrieval augmented generation. Our system integrators, technology solution providers, and system builders are bringing NVIDIA NIM Agent Blueprints to enterprises. NVIDIA NIM and NIM Agent Blueprints are available through the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform, which has great momentum. We expect our software, SaaS, and support revenue to approach a $2 billion annual run rate exiting this year, with NVIDIA AI Enterprise notably contributing to growth. Moving to gaming and AI PC. Gaming revenue of $2.88 billion increased 9% sequentially and 16% year on year. We saw sequential growth in console, notebook, and desktop revenue, and demand is strong and growing and channel inventory remains healthy. Every PC with RTX is an AI PC. RTX PCs can deliver up to 1,300 AI tops and are now over 200 RTX AI laptops designed from leading PC manufacturers. With 600 AI-powered applications and games and an installed base of 100 million devices, RTX is set to revolutionize consumer experiences with generative AI. NVIDIA ACE, a suite of generative AI technologies is available for RTX AI PCs. Megabreak is the first game to use NVIDIA ACE, including our small language model, Nemotron 4B optimized on device inference. The NVIDIA gaming ecosystem continues to grow. Recently added RTX and DLSS titles include Indiana Jones and The Great Circle, Awakening, and Dragon Age: The Vanguard. The GeForce NOW library continues to expand with total catalog size of over 2,000 titles, the most content of any cloud gaming service. Moving to pro visualization. Revenue of $454 million was up 6% sequentially and 20% year on year. Demand is being driven by AI and graphic use cases, including model fine-tuning and Omniverse-related workloads. Automotive and manufacturing were among the key industry verticals driving growth this quarter. Companies are racing to digitalize workflows to drive efficiency across their operations. The world's largest electronics manufacturer, Foxconn, is using NVIDIA Omniverse to power digital twins of the physical plants that produce NVIDIA Blackwell systems. And several large global enterprises, including Mercedes-Benz, signed multiyear contracts for NVIDIA Omniverse Cloud to build industrial digital twins of factories. We announced new NVIDIA USD NIMs and connectors to open Omniverse to new industries and enable developers to incorporate generative AI copilots and agents into USD workloads, accelerating our ability to build highly accurate virtual worlds. WPP is implementing the USD NIM microservices in its generative AI-enabled content creation pipeline for customers such as The Coca-Cola Company. Moving to automotive and robotics. Revenue was $346 million, up 5% sequentially and up 37% year on year. Year-on-year growth was driven by the new customer ramp in self-driving platforms and increased demand for AI cockpit solutions. At the consumer -- at the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Conference, NVIDIA won the Autonomous Brand Challenge in the end-to-end driving upscale category, outperforming more than 400 entries worldwide. Boston Dynamics, BYD Electronics, Figure, Intrinsyc, Siemens, and Teradyne Robotics are using the NVIDIA Isaac robotics platform for autonomous robot arms, humanoids, and mobile robots. Now, moving to the rest of the P&L. GAAP gross margins were 75.1% and non-GAAP gross margins were 75.7%, down sequentially due to a higher mix of new products within Data Center and inventory provisions for low-yielding Blackwell material. Sequentially, GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses were up 12%, primarily reflecting higher compensation-related costs. Cash flow from operations was $14.5 billion. In Q2, we utilized cash of $7.4 billion toward shareholder returns in the form of share repurchases and cash dividends, reflecting the increase in dividend per shareholder. Our board of directors recently approved a $50 billion share repurchase authorization to add to our remaining $7.5 billion of authorization at the end of Q2. Let me turn the outlook for the third quarter. Total revenue is expected to be $32.5 billion, plus or minus 2%. Our third-quarter revenue outlook incorporates continued growth of our Hopper architecture and sampling of our Blackwell products. We expect Blackwell production ramp in Q4. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 74.4% and 75%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. As our Data Center mix continues to shift to new products, we expect this trend to continue into the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025. For the full year, we expect gross margins to be in the mid-70% range. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $4.3 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively. Full-year operating expenses are expected to grow in the mid- to upper 40% range as we work on developing our next generation of products. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be about $350 million, including gains and losses from nonaffiliated investments and publicly held equity securities. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 17%, plus or minus 1%, excluding any discrete items. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website. We are now going to open the call for questions.

There are something like 100 different types of Blackwell-based systems that are built that were shown at Computex, and we're enabling our ecosystem to start sampling those.

Q2_2025,Toshiya Hari,Analyst,"Hi. Thank you so much for taking the question. Jensen, I had a relatively longer-term question. As you may know, there's a pretty heated debate in the market on your customers and customers' customers return on investment and what that means for the sustainability of capex going forward. Internally at NVIDIA, like what are you guys watching? What's on your dashboard as you try to gauge customer return and how that impacts capex? And then a quick follow-up maybe for Colette. I think your sovereign AI number for the full year went up maybe a couple of billion. What's driving the improved outlook and how should we think about fiscal '26? Thank you.",neutral,0.542142093,Neutral,Neutral,0.05,0.1,0.7,0.1,0.05,Neutral
Q2_2025,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Thanks, Toshiya. First of all, when I said ship production in Q4, I mean shipping out, I don't mean starting to ship, but I mean -- I don't mean starting production but shipping up. On the longer-term question, let's take a step back. And you've heard me say that we're going through two simultaneous platform transitions at the same time. The first one is transitioning from accelerated computing to -- from general-purpose computing to accelerated computing. And the reason for that is because CPU scaling has been known to be slowing for some time and it has slowed to a crawl. And yet the amount of computing demand continues to grow quite significantly. You could maybe even estimate it to be doubling every single year. And so, if we don't have a new approach, computing inflation would be driving up the cost for every company, and it would be driving up the energy consumption of data centers around the world. In fact, you're seeing that. And so, the answer is accelerated computing. We know that accelerated computing, of course, speeds up applications. It also enables you to do computing at a much larger scale, for example, scientific simulations or database processing, but what that translates directly to is lower cost and lower energy consumed. And in fact, this week, there's a blog that came out that talked about a whole bunch of new libraries that we offer. And that's really the core of the first platform transition, going from general-purpose computing to accelerated computing. And it's not unusual to see someone save 90% of their computing cost. And the reason for that is, of course, you just sped up an application 50x. You would expect the computing cost to decline quite significantly. The second was enabled by accelerated computing because we drove down the cost of training large language models or training deep learning so incredibly that it is now possible to have gigantic scale models, multitrillion-parameter models and train it on -- pretrain it on just about the world's knowledge corpus and let the model go figure out how to understand human language representation and how to codify knowledge into its neural networks and how to learn reasoning, and so which caused the generative AI revolution. Now, generative AI, taking a step back about why it is that we went so deeply into it is because it's not just a feature, it's not just the capability. It's a fundamental new way of doing software. Instead of human-engineered algorithms, we now have data. We tell the AI, we tell the model, we tell the computer what are the expected answers. What are our previous observations? And then for it to figure out what the algorithm is, what's the function. It learns a universal -- AI is a bit of a universal function approximator and it learns the function. And so, you could learn the function of almost anything. And anything that you have that's predictable, anything that has structure, anything that you have previous examples of. And so, now here we are with generative AI. It's a fundamental new form of computer science. It's affecting how every layer of computing is done from CPU to GPU, from human-engineered algorithms to machine-learned algorithms, and the type of applications you could now develop and produce is fundamentally remarkable. And there are several things that are happening in generative AI. So, the first thing that's happening is the frontier models are growing in quite substantial scale. And they're still seeing -- we're still all seeing the benefits of scaling. And whenever you double the size of a model, you also have to more than double the size of the data set to go train it. And so, the amount of flops necessary in order to create that model goes up quadratically. And so, it's not unexpected to see that the next-generation models could take 10, 20, 40 times more compute than last generation. So, we have to continue to drive the generational performance up quite significantly so we can drive down the energy consumed and drive down the cost necessary to do it. And so, the first one is there are larger frontier models trained on more modalities. And surprisingly, there are more frontier model makers than last year. And so, you have more and more and more. That's one of the dynamics going on in generative AI. The second is although it's below the tip of the iceberg, what we see are ChatGPT image generators. We see coding. We use generative AI for coding quite extensively here at NVIDIA now. We, of course, have a lot of digital designers and things like that. But those are kind of the tip of the iceberg. What's below the iceberg are the largest systems, largest computing systems in the world today, which are -- and you've heard me talk about this in the past, which are recommender systems moving from CPUs. It's now moving from CPUs to generative AI. So, recommender systems, ad generation, custom ad generation targeting ads at very large scale and quite hyper-targeting, search, and user-generated content, these are all very large-scale applications have now evolved to generative AI. Of course, the number of generative AI start-ups is generating tens of billions of dollars of cloud renting opportunities for our cloud partners. And sovereign AI, countries that are now realizing that their data is their natural and national resource and they have to use AI, build their own AI infrastructure so that they could have their own digital intelligence. Enterprise AI, as Colette mentioned earlier, is starting, and you might have seen our announcement that the world's leading IT companies are joining us to take the NVIDIA AI Enterprise platform to the world's enterprises. The companies that we're talking to, so many of them are just so incredibly excited to drive more productivity out of the company. And then general robotics. The big transformation last year as we are able to now learn physical AI from watching video and human demonstration and synthetic data generation from reinforcement learning from systems like Omniverse, we are now able to work with just about every robotics companies now to start thinking about, start building general robotics. And so, you can see that there are just so many different directions that generative AI is going. And so, we're actually seeing the momentum of generative AI accelerating.",neutral,0.91061765,Neutral,Slightly Positive,0.2,0.4,0.3,0.05,0.05,Strong Positive
Q2_2025,Colette M. Kress,"Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President","And Toshiya, to answer your question regarding sovereign AI and our goals in terms of growth, in terms of revenue, it certainly is a unique and growing opportunity, something that surfaced with generative AI and the desires of countries around the world to have their own generative AI that would be able to incorporate their own language, incorporate their own culture, incorporate their own data in that country. So, more and more excitement around these models and what they can be specific for those countries. So, yes, we are seeing some growth opportunity in front of us.

Q2_2025,Joe Moore,Analyst,"Great. Thank you. Jensen, in the press release, you talked about Blackwell anticipation being incredible. But it seems like Hopper demand is also really strong. I mean, you're guiding for a very strong quarter without Blackwell in October. So, how long do you see sort of coexisting strong demand for both? And can you talk about the transition to Blackwell? Do you see people intermixing clusters? Do you think most of the Blackwell activities, new clusters? Just some sense of what that transition looks like.",neutral,0.854673266,Neutral,Neutral,0.05,0.1,0.7,0.1,0.05,Neutral
Q2_2025,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah. Thanks, Joe. The demand for Hopper is really strong. And it's true, the demand for Blackwell is incredible. There's a couple of reasons for that. The first reason is if you just look at the world's cloud service providers, the amount of GPU capacity they have available, it's basically none. And the reason for that is because they're either being deployed internally for accelerating their own workloads, data processing, for example. Data processing, we hardly ever talk about it because it's mundane. It's not very cool because it doesn't generate a picture or generate words. But almost every single company in the world processes data in the background. And NVIDIA's GPUs are the only accelerators on the planet that process and accelerate data. SQL data, Panda's data, data science toolkits like Panda's, and the new one, Polar's. These are the ones -- the most popular data processing platforms in the world. And aside from CPUs, which as I've mentioned before, really running out of steam, NVIDIA's accelerated computing is really the only way to get boosting performance out of that. And so, number one is the primary -- the No. 1 use case long before generative AI came along is that the migration of applications one after another to accelerated computing. The second is, of course, the rentals. They're renting capacity to model makers. They're renting it to start-up companies. And a generative AI company spends the vast majority of their invested capital into infrastructure so that they could use an AI to help them create products. And so, these companies need it now. They just simply can't afford -- you just raise money. They want you to put it to use now. You have processing that you have to do. You can't do it next year, you got to do it today. And so, there's a fair -- that's one reason. The second reason for Hopper demand right now is because of the race to the next plateau. The first person to the next plateau gets to be -- get to introduce a revolutionary level of AI. The second person who gets there is incrementally better or about the same. And so, the ability to systematically and consistently race to the next plateau and be the first one there is how you establish leadership. NVIDIA is constantly doing that, and we show that to the world and the GPUs we make and the AI factories that we make, the networking systems that we make, the SoCs we create. I mean, we want to set the pace. We want to be consistently the world's best. And that's the reason why we drive ourselves so hard. Of course, we also want to see our dreams come true and all of the capabilities that we imagine in the future and the benefits that we can bring to society, we want to see all that come true. And so, these model makers are the same. Of course, they want to be the world's best. They want to be the world's first. And although Blackwell will start shipping out in billions of dollars at the end of this year, the standing up of the capacity is still probably weeks and a month or so away. And so, between now and then is a lot of generative AI market dynamic. And so, everybody is just really in a hurry. It's either operational reasons that they need it. They need accelerated computing. They don't want to build any more general-purpose computing infrastructure and even Hopper. Of course, H200 is state-of-the-art. Hopper, if you have a choice between building CPU infrastructure right now for business or Hopper infrastructure for business right now, that decision is relatively clear. And so, I think people are just clamoring to transition the $1 trillion of established installed infrastructure to a modern infrastructure and Hopper's state-of-the-art.

Q2_2025,Matt Ramsay,Analyst,"Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everybody. Jensen, I wanted to kind of circle back to an earlier question about the debate that investors are having about the ROI on all of this capex. And hopefully, this question and the distinction will make some sense. But what I'm having discussions about is with like the percentage of folks that you see that are spending all of this money and looking to sort of push the frontier toward AGI convergence and, as you just said, a new plateau in capability, and they're going to spend regardless to get to that level of capability because it opens up so many doors for the industry and for their company versus customers that are really, really focused today on capex versus ROI. I don't know if that distinction makes sense. I'm just trying to get a sense of how you're seeing the priorities of people that are putting the dollars in the ground on this new technology and what their priorities are and their time frames are for that investment. Thanks.",neutral,0.811668456,Neutral,Neutral,0.05,0.1,0.7,0.1,0.05,Neutral
Q2_2025,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Thanks, Matt. The people who are investing in NVIDIA infrastructure are getting returns on it right away. It's the best ROI infrastructure, computing infrastructure investment you can make today. And so, one way to think through it, probably the most -- the easiest way to think through it is just go back to first principles. You have $1 trillion worth of general-purpose computing infrastructure. And the question is, do you want to build more of that or not? And for every $1 billion worth of Juniper CPU-based infrastructure that you stand up, you probably rent it for less than $1 billion. And so, because it's commoditized, there's already $1 trillion on the ground. What's the point of getting more? And so, the people who are clamoring to get this infrastructure, one, when they build out Hopper-based infrastructure and soon, Blackwell-based infrastructure, they start saving money. That's a tremendous return on investment. And the reason why they start saving money is because data processing saves money, and data processing is probably just a giant part of it already. And so, recommender systems save money, so on and so forth, OK? And so, you start saving money. The second thing is everything you stand up are going to get rented because so many companies are being founded to create generative AI. And so, your capacity gets rented right away and the return on investment of that is really good. And then the third reason is your own business. Do you want to either create the next frontier yourself or your own Internet services benefit from a next-generation ad system or a next-generation recommender system or a next-generation search system? So, for your own services, for your own stores, for your own user-generated content, social media platforms, for your own services, generative AI is also a fast ROI. And so, there's a lot of ways you could think through it. But at the core, it's because it is the best computing infrastructure you could put in the ground today. The world of general-purpose computing is shifting to accelerated computing. The world of human-engineered software is moving to generative AI software. If you were to build infrastructure to modernize your cloud and your data centers, build it with accelerated computing NVIDIA. That's the best way to do it.

Q2_2025,Timothy Arcuri,Analyst,"Thanks a lot. I had a question on the shape of the revenue growth, both near and longer term. I know Colette, you did increase opex for the year. And if I look at the increase in your purchase commitments and your supply obligations, that's also quite bullish. On the other hand, there's some school of thought that not that many customers really seem ready for liquid cooling, and I do recognize that some of these racks can be air-cooled. But Jensen, is that something to consider sort of on the shape of how Blackwell is going to ramp? And then I guess when you look beyond next year, which is obviously going to be a great year and you look into '26, do you worry about any other gating factors like, say, the power supply chain or at some point, models start to get smaller? I'm just wondering if you can speak to that. Thanks.",neutral,0.846344113,Neutral,Neutral,0.05,0.1,0.7,0.1,0.05,Neutral
Q2_2025,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,"I'm going to work backwards. I really appreciate the question, Tim. So, remember, the world is moving from general-purpose computing to accelerated computing. And the world builds about $1 trillion worth of data centers. $1 trillion worth of data centers in a few years will be all accelerated computing. In the past, no GPUs are in data centers, just CPUs. In the future, every single data center will have GPUs. And the reason for that is very clear: because we need to accelerate workloads so that we can continue to be sustainable, continue to drive down the cost of computing so that when we do more computing, we don't experience computing inflation. Second, we need GPUs for a new computing model called generative AI that we could all acknowledge is going to be quite transformative to the future of computing. And so, I think working backwards, the way to think about that is the next $1 trillion of the world's infrastructure will clearly be different than the last $1 trillion, and it will be vastly accelerated. With respect to the shape of our ramp, we offer multiple configurations of Blackwell. Blackwell comes in either a Blackwell classic, if you will, that uses the HGX form factor that we pioneered with Volta. And I think it was Volta. And so, we've been shipping the HGX form factor for some time. It is air-cooled. The Grace Blackwell is liquid-cooled. However, the number of data centers that want to go to liquid-cooled is quite significant. And the reason for that is because we can, in a liquid-cooled data center, in any data center -- power-limited data center, whatever size data center you choose, you could install and deploy anywhere from three to five times the AI throughput compared to the past. And so, liquid cooling is cheaper. Liquid cooling, our TCO is better, and liquid cooling allows you to have the benefit of this capability we call NVLink, which allows us to expand it to 72 Grace Blackwell packages, which has essentially 144 GPUs. And so, imagine 144 GPUs connected in NVLink. And that, we're increasingly showing you the benefits of that. And the next click is obviously very low latency, very high throughput large language model inference, and the large NVLink domain is going to be a game changer for that. And so, I think people are very comfortable deploying both. And so, almost every CSP we're working with are deploying some of both. And so, I'm pretty confident that we'll ramp it up just fine. Your second question out of the third is that looking forward, yes, next year is going to be a great year. We expect to grow our Data Center business quite significantly next year. Blackwell is going to be a complete game changer for the industry. And Blackwell is going to carry into the following year. And as I mentioned earlier, working backwards from first principles, remember that computing is going through two platform transitions at the same time. And that's just really, really important to keep your head on -- your mind focused on, which is general-purpose computing is shifting to accelerated computing, and human-engineered software is going to transition to generative AI or artificial intelligence-learned software.

You said you expected Hopper demand to strengthen in the second half. Does that mean Hopper strengthens Q3 to Q4 as well on top of Blackwell adding several billion dollars? And the second question on gross margins. If I have mid-70s for the year, let's say, where I want to draw that, if I have 75 for the year, I'd be something like 71 to 72 for Q4, somewhere in that range.

Q2_2025,Colette M. Kress,"Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President","So, Stacy, let's first take your question that you had about Hopper and Blackwell. So, we believe our Hopper will continue to grow into the second half. We have many new products for Hopper, our existing products for Hopper that we believe will start continuing to ramp in the next quarters, including our Q3 and those new products moving to Q4. So, let's say, Hopper there for versus H1 is a growth opportunity for that. Additionally, we have the Blackwell on top of that, and the Blackwell starting ramping in Q4. So, I hope that helps you on those two pieces. Your second piece is in terms of our gross margin. We provided gross margin for our Q3. We provided our gross margin on a non-GAAP at about 75. We'll work with all the different transitions that we're going through, but we do believe we can do that 75 in Q3. We provided that we're still on track for the full year also in the mid-70s or approximately the 75. So, we're going to see some slight difference possibly in Q4, again with our transitions and the different cost structures that we have on our new product introductions.

Q2_2025,Colette M. Kress,"Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President","Let me talk about a bit in terms of our disclosure in terms of the 10-Q, a required disclosure in a choice of geographies. Very challenging sometimes to create that right disclosure as we have to come up with one key piece. The pieces in terms of we have in terms of who we sell to and/or specifically who we invoice to, and so what you're seeing in terms of there is who we invoice. That's not necessarily where the product will eventually be and where it may even travel to the end customer. These are just moving to our OEMs or ODMs and our system integrators for the most part across our product portfolio. So, what you're seeing there is sometimes just a swift shift in terms of who they are using to complete their full configuration before those things are going into the data center, going into notebooks and those pieces of it. And that shift happens from time to time. But yes, our China number there are invoicing to China. Keep in mind that is incorporating both gaming, also Data Center, also automotive in those numbers that we have. Going back to your statement and regarding gross margin and also what we're seeing in terms of what we're looking at for Hopper and Blackwell in terms of revenue. Hopper will continue to grow in the second half. We'll continue to grow from what we are currently seeing. Determining that exact mix in each Q3 and Q4, we don't have here. We are not here to guide yet in terms of Q4. But we do see right now the demand expectations. We do see the visibility that that will be a growth opportunity in Q4.

Q2_2025,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah. Thanks. Let's see. I think the first answer to your -- the answer to your first question is that the reason why our velocity is so high is simultaneously because the complexity of the model is growing, and we want to continue to drive its cost down. It's growing so we want to continue to increase its scale. And we believe that by continuing to scale the AI models, that we'll reach a level of extraordinary usefulness and that it would open up, realize the next industrial revolution. We believe it. And so, we're going to drive ourselves really hard to continue to go up that scale. We have the ability, fairly uniquely, to integrate, to design an AI factory because we have all the parts. It's not possible to come up with a new AI factory every year unless you have all the parts. And so, we have -- next year, we're going to ship a lot more CPUs than we've ever had in the history of our company, more GPUs, of course, but also NVLink switches, CX DPUs, ConnectX for East and West, BlueField DPUs for North and South, and data and storage processing to InfiniBand for supercomputing centers, to Ethernet, which is a brand-new product for us, which is well on its way to becoming a multibillion-dollar business to bring AI to Ethernet. And so, the fact that we could build -- we have access to all of this, we have one architectural stack, as you know, it allows us to introduce new capabilities to the market as we complete it. Otherwise, what happens, you ship these parts, you go find customers to sell it to, and then you've got to build -- somebody's got to build up an AI factory, and the AI factory has got a mountain of software. And so, it's not about who integrates it. We love the fact that our supply chain is disintegrated in the sense that we could service Quanta, Foxconn, HP, Dell, Lenovo, Super Micro. We used to be able to serve ZTE. They were recently purchased and so on and so forth. And so, the number of ecosystem partners that we have, Gigabyte, the number of ecosystem partners that we have that allows them to take our architecture, which all works, but integrated in a bespoke way into all of the world's cloud service providers, enterprise data centers, the scale and reach necessary from our ODMs and our integrators, integrated supply chain, is vast and gigantic because the world is huge. And so, that part, we don't want to do and we're not good at doing. And -- but we know how to design the AI infrastructure, provided the way that customers would like it and lets the ecosystem integrate it. Well, yes. So, anyways, that's the reason why.

Q2_2025,Aaron Rakers,Analyst,"Yes. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to go back into the Blackwell product cycle. One of the questions that we tend to get asked is how you see the rack scale system mix dynamic as you think about leveraging NVLink, you think about GB NVL72 and how that go-to-market dynamic looks as far as the Blackwell product cycle. I guess to put it simply, how do you see that mix of rack scale systems as we start to think about the Blackwell cycle playing out?",neutral,0.913308024,Neutral,Neutral,0.05,0.1,0.7,0.1,0.05,Neutral
Q2_2025,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah. Aaron, thanks. The Blackwell rack system, it's designed and architected as a rack but it's sold in disaggregated system components. We don't sell the whole rack. And the reason for that is because everybody's rack's a little different surprisingly. Some of them are OCP standards, some of them are not. Some of them are enterprise. And the power limits for everybody could be a little different. Choice of CDUs, the choice of power bus bars, the configuration and integration into people's data centers, all different. And so, the way we designed it, we architected the whole rack. The software is going to work perfectly across the whole rack. And then we provide the system components. Like for example, the CPU and GPU compute board is then integrated into an MGX. It's a modular system architecture. MGX is completely ingenious. And we have MGX ODMs and integrators and OEMs all over the plant. And so, just about any configuration you would like, where you would like that 3,000-pound rack to be delivered, it's got to be close to. It has to be integrated and assembled close to the data center because it's fairly heavy. And so everything from the supply chain from the moment that we ship the GPU, CPUs, the switches, the NICs, from that point forward, the integration is done quite close to the location of the CSPs and the locations of the data centers. And so, you can imagine how many data centers in the world there are and how many logistics hubs we've scaled out to with our ODM partners. And so, I think because we show it as one rack and because it's always rendered that way and shown that way, we might have left the impression that we're doing the integration. Our customers hate that we do integration. The supply chain hates us doing integration. They want to do the integration. That's their value-add. There's a final design-in, if you will. It's not quite as simple as shimmy into a data center but the design fit-in is really complicated. And so, the design fit-in, the installation, the bring-up, the repair and replace, that entire cycle is done all over the world. And we have a sprawling network of ODM and OEM partners that does this incredibly well. So, integration is not the reason why we're doing racks. It's the anti-reason of doing it.

Q2_2025,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Thank you. Let me make a couple more -- make a couple of comments that I made earlier again. The data center worldwide are in full steam to modernize the entire computing stack with accelerated computing and generative AI. Hopper demand remains strong and the anticipation for Blackwell is incredible. Let me highlight the top five things, the top five things of our company. Accelerated computing has reached the tipping point. CPU scaling slows. Developers must accelerate everything possible. Accelerated computing starts with CUDA-X libraries. New libraries open new markets for NVIDIA. We released many new libraries, including CUDA-X Accelerated Polars, Pandas, and Spark, the leading data science and data processing libraries, CUVI-S for vector databases. This is incredibly hot right now. Ariel and for 5G wireless base station, a whole suite of a whole world of data centers that we can go into now. Parabricks for gene sequencing and AlphaFold2 for protein structure prediction is now CUDA accelerated. We are at the beginning of our journey to modernize $1 trillion worth of data centers from general-purpose computing to accelerated computing. That's number one. Number two, Blackwall is a step-function leap over Hopper. Blackwell is an AI infrastructure platform, not just the GPU. Also happens to be the name of our GPU but it's an AI infrastructure platform. As we reveal more of Blackwell and sample systems to our partners and customers, the extent of Blackwell's lead becomes clear. The Blackwell vision took nearly five years and seven one-of-a-kind chips to realize, the Gray CPU, the Blackwell dual GPU, and a colos package, ConnectX DPU for East-West traffic, BlueField DPU for North-South and storage traffic, NVLink switch for all-to-all GPU communications, and Quantum and Spectrum-X for both InfiniBand and Ethernet can support the massive traffic of AI. Blackwell AI factories are building-size computers. NVIDIA designed and optimized the Blackwell platform, full stack end to end, from chips, systems, networking, even structured cables, power and cooling, and mounds of software to make it fast for customers to build AI factories. These are very capital-intensive infrastructures. Customers want to deploy it as soon as they get their hands on the equipment and deliver the best performance and TCO. Blackwell provides three to five times more AI throughput in a power-limited data center than Hopper. The third is NVLink. This is a very big deal with its all-to-all GPU switch is game-changing. The Blackwell system lets us connect 144 GPUs in 72 GB200 packages into one NVLink domain, with an aggregate NVLink bandwidth of 259 terabytes per second in one rack. Just to put that in perspective, that's about 10x higher than Hopper. 259 terabytes per second kind of makes sense because you need to boost the training of multitrillion-parameter models on trillions of tokens. And so, that natural amount of data needs to be moved around from GPU to GPU. For inference, NVLink is vital for low-latency, high-throughput large language model token generation. We now have three networking platforms, NVLink for GPU scale-up, Quantum InfiniBand for supercomputing and dedicated AI factories, and Spectrum-X for AI on Ethernet. NVIDIA's networking footprint is much bigger than before. Generative AI momentum is accelerating. Generative AI frontier model makers are racing to scale to the next AI plateau to increase model safety and IQ. We're also scaling to understand more modalities from text, images, and video to 3D physics, chemistry, and biology. Chatbots, coding AIs, and image generators are growing fast but it's just the tip of the iceberg. Internet services are deploying generative AI for large-scale recommenders, ad targeting, and search systems. AI start-ups are consuming tens of billions of dollars yearly of CSP's cloud capacity, and countries are recognizing the importance of AI and investing in sovereign AI infrastructure. And NVIDIA AI, NVIDIA Omniverse is opening up the next era of AI, general robotics. And now the enterprise AI wave has started, and we're poised to help companies transform their businesses. The NVIDIA AI Enterprise platform consists of Nemo, NIMs, NIM Agent Blueprints, and AI Foundry that our ecosystem partners, the world-leading IT companies used to help companies customize AI models and build bespoke AI applications. Enterprises can then deploy on NVIDIA AI Enterprise run time, and at $4,500 per GPU per year, NVIDIA AI Enterprise is an exceptional value for deploying AI anywhere. And for NVIDIA software, TAM can be significant as the CUDA-compatible GPU installed base grows from millions to tens of millions. And as Colette mentioned, NVIDIA software will exit the year at a $2 billion run rate. Thank you all for joining us today.

Q3_2025,Colette M. Kress,"Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President","Thank you, Stewart. Q3 was another record quarter. We continue to deliver incredible growth. Revenue of $35.1 billion was up 17% sequentially and up 94% year on year and well above our outlook of $32.5 billion. All market platforms posted strong sequential and year-over-year growth, fueled by the adoption of NVIDIA accelerated computing and AI. Starting with data center. Another record was achieved in data center. Revenue of $30.8 billion, up 17% sequential and up 112% year on year. NVIDIA Hopper demand is exceptional, and sequentially, NVIDIA H200 sales increased significantly to double-digit billions, the fastest prod ramp in our company's history. The H200 delivers up to 2x faster inference performance and up to 50% improved TCO. Cloud service providers were approximately half of our data center sales with revenue increasing more than 2x year on year. CSPs deployed NVIDIA H200 infrastructure and high-speed networking with installations scaling to tens of thousands of DPUs to grow their business and serve rapidly rising demand for AI training and inference workloads. NVIDIA H200-powered cloud instances are now available from AWS, CoreWeave, and Microsoft Azure, with Google Cloud and OCI coming soon. Alongside significant growth from our large CSPs, NVIDIA GPU regional cloud revenue jumped year on year as North America, India, and Asia Pacific regions ramped NVIDIA Cloud instances and sovereign cloud build-outs. Consumer Internet revenue more than doubled year on year as companies scaled their NVIDIA Hopper infrastructure to support next-generation AI models training, multimodal, and agentic AI, deep learning recommender engines, and generative AI inference and content creation workloads. NVIDIA Ampere and Hopper infrastructures are fueling inference revenue growth for customers. NVIDIA is the largest inference platform in the world. Our large installed base and rich software ecosystem encourage developers to optimize for NVIDIA and deliver continued performance and TCO improvements. Rapid advancements in NVIDIA software algorithms boosted Hopper inference throughput by an incredible 5x in one year and cut time to first token by 5x. Our upcoming release of NVIDIA NIM will boost Hopper inference performance by an additional 2.4x. Continuous performance optimizations are a hallmark of NVIDIA and drive increasingly economic returns for the entire NVIDIA installed base. Blackwell is in full production after a successfully executed change. We shipped 13,000 GPU samples to customers in the third quarter, including one of the first Blackwell DGX engineering samples to OpenAI. Blackwell is a full-stack, full-infrastructure, AI data center scale system with customizable configurations needed to address a diverse and growing AI market from x86 to ARM, training to inferencing GPUs, InfiniBand to Ethernet switches, and NVLink. And from liquid-cooled to air-cooled, every customer is racing to be the first to market. Blackwell is now in the hands of all of our major partners, and they are working to bring up their data centers. We are integrating Blackwell systems into the diverse data center configurations of our customers. Blackwell demand is staggering, and we are racing to scale supply to meet the incredible demand customers are placing on us. Customers are gearing up to deploy Blackwell at scale. Oracle announced the world's first Zettascale AI cloud computing clusters that can scale to over 131,000 Blackwell GPUs to help enterprises train and deploy some of the most demanding next-generation AI models. Yesterday, Microsoft announced they will be the first CSP to offer, in private preview, Blackwell-based cloud instances powered by NVIDIA GB200 and Quantum InfiniBand. Last week, Blackwell made its debut on the most recent round of MLPerf training results, sweeping the per GPU benchmarks and delivering a 2.2x leap in performance over Hopper. The results also demonstrate our relentless pursuit to drive down the cost of compute. The 64 Blackwell GPUs are required to run the GPT-3 benchmark compared to 256 H100s or a 4x reduction in cost. NVIDIA Blackwell architecture with NVLink Switch enables up to 30x faster inference performance and a new level of inference scaling, throughput, and response time that is excellent for running new reasoning inference applications like OpenAI's o1 model. With every new platform shift, a wave of start-ups is created. Hundreds of AI-native companies are already delivering AI services with great success. Though Google, Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI are the headliners, Anthropic, Perplexity, Mistral, Adobe Firefly, Runway, Midjourney, Light Tricks, Harvey, Podium, Purser, and the Bridge are seeing great success while thousands of AI-native start-ups are building new services. The next wave of AI are Enterprise AI and industrial AI. Enterprise AI is in full throttle. NVIDIA AI Enterprise, which includes NVIDIA NeMo and NIMs micro services is an operating platform of agentic AI. Industry leaders are using NVIDIA AI to build Copilots and agents. Working with NVIDIA, Cadence, Cloudera, Cohesity, NetApp, Salesforce, SAP, and ServiceNow are racing to accelerate development of these applications with the potential for billions of agents to be deployed in the coming years. Consulting leaders like Accenture and Deloitte are taking NVIDIA AI to the world's enterprises. Accenture launched a new business group with 30,000 professionals trained on NVIDIA AI technology to help facilitate this global build-out. Additionally, Accenture, with over 707,000 employees, is leveraging NVIDIA-powered agentic AI applications internally, including one case that cuts manual steps in marketing campaigns for 25% to 35%. Nearly 1,000 companies are using NVIDIA NIM, and the speed of its uptake is evident in NVIDIA AI Enterprise monetization. We expect NVIDIA AI Enterprise full-year revenue to increase over 2x from last year, and our pipeline continues to build. Overall, our software, service, and support revenue is annualizing at $1.5 billion, and we expect to exit this year annualizing at over $2 billion. Industrial AI and robotics are accelerating. This is triggered by breakthroughs in physical AI, foundation models that understand the physical world, like NVIDIA NeMo for enterprise AI agents. We built NVIDIA Omniverse for developers to build, train, and operate industrial AI and robotics. Some of the largest industrial manufacturers in the world are adopting NVIDIA Omniverse to accelerate their businesses, automate their workflows, and to achieve new levels of operating efficiency. Foxconn, the world's largest electronics manufacturer, is using digital twin and industrial AI built on NVIDIA Omniverse to speed the bring-up of its Blackwell factories and drive new levels of efficiency. In its Mexico facility alone, Foxconn expects to reduce -- a reduction of over 30% in annual hour usage. From a geographic perspective, our data center revenue in China grew sequentially due to shipments of export-compliant Hopper products to industries. As a percentage of total data center revenue, it remained well below levels prior to the onset of export controls. We expect the market in China to remain very competitive going forward. We will continue to comply with export controls while serving our customers. Our AI initiatives continue to gather momentum as countries embrace NVIDIA accelerated computing for a new industrial revolution powered by AI. India's leading CSPs include product communications and data services are building AI factories for tens of thousands of NVIDIA GPUs. By year-end, they will have boosted NVIDIA GPU deployments in the country by nearly 10x. Infosys, TFC, Wipro are adopting NVIDIA AI Enterprise and upskilling nearly 0.5 million developers and consultants to help clients build and run AI agents on our platform. In Japan, SoftBank is building the nation's most powerful AI supercomputer with NVIDIA DGX Blackwell and Quantum InfiniBand. SoftBank is also partnering with NVIDIA to transform the telecommunications network into a distributed AI network with NVIDIA AI Aerial and ARN platform that can process both 5G RAN on AI on CUDA. We are launching the same in the U.S. with T-Mobile. Leaders across Japan, including Fujitsu, NEC, and NTT are adopting NVIDIA AI Enterprise, and major consulting companies, including EY Strategy and Consulting will help bring NVIDIA AI technology to Japan's industries. Networking revenue increased 20% year on year. Areas of sequential revenue growth include InfiniBand and Ethernet switches, SmartNICs, and BlueField DPUs. Though networking revenue was sequentially down, networking demand is strong and growing, and we anticipate sequential growth in Q4. CSPs and supercomputing centers are using and adopting the NVIDIA InfiniBand platform to power new H200 clusters. NVIDIA Spectrum-X Ethernet for AI revenue increased over 3x year on year. And our pipeline continues to build with multiple CSPs and consumer Internet companies planning large cluster deployments. Traditional Ethernet was not designed for AI. NVIDIA Spectrum-X uniquely leverages technology previously exclusive to InfiniBand to enable customers to achieve massive scale of their compute. Utilizing Spectrum-X, xAI's Colossus 100,000-Hopper supercomputer experienced zero application latency degradation and maintained 95% of data throughput versus 60% for traditional Ethernet. Now, moving to Gaming and AI PCs. Gaming revenue of $3.3 billion increased 14% sequentially and 15% year on year. Q3 was a great quarter for Gaming with notebook, console, and desktop revenue all growing sequentially and year on year. RTX end demand was fueled by strong back-to-school sales as consumers continue to choose GeForce RTX GPUs and devices to power gaming, creative, and AI applications. Channel inventory remains healthy, and we are gearing up for the holiday season. We began shipping new GeForce RTX AI PC with up to 321 AI TOPS from ASUS and MSI with Microsoft's Copilot+ capabilities anticipated in Q4. These machines harness the power of RTX ray tracing and AI technologies to supercharge gaming, photo, and video editing, image generation, and coding. This past quarter, we celebrated the 25th anniversary of the GeForce 256, the world's first GPU. The transforming executing graphics to igniting the AI revolution. NVIDIA's GPUs have been the driving force behind some of the most consequential technologies of our time. Moving to ProViz. Revenue of $486 million was up 7% sequentially and 17% year on year. NVIDIA RTX workstations continue to be the preferred choice to power professional graphics, design, and engineering-related workloads. Additionally, AI is emerging as a powerful demand driver, including autonomous vehicle simulation, generative AI model prototyping for productivity-related use cases, and generative AI content creation in media and entertainment. Moving to Automotive. Revenue was a record $449 million, up 30% sequentially and up 72% year on year. Strong growth was driven by self-driving brands of NVIDIA Orin and robust end market demand for NAVs. Global Cars is rolling out its fully electric SUV built on NVIDIA Orin and DriveOS. OK, moving to the rest of the P&L. GAAP gross margin was 74.6% and non-GAAP gross margin was 75%, down sequentially, primarily driven by a mix shift of the H100 systems to more complex and higher-cost systems within data center. Sequentially, GAAP operating expenses and non-GAAP operating expenses were up 9% due to higher compute, infrastructure, and engineering development costs for new product introductions. In Q3, we returned $11.2 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and cash dividends. Well, let me turn to the outlook for the fourth quarter. Total revenue is expected to be $37.5 billion, plus or minus 2%, which incorporates continued demand for Hopper architecture and the initial ramp of our Blackwell products. While demand greatly exceed supply, we are on track to exceed our previous Blackwell revenue estimate of several billion dollars as our visibility into supply continues to increase. On Gaming, although sell-through was strong in Q3, we expect fourth-quarter revenue to decline sequentially due to supply constraints. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 73% and 73.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. Blackwell is a customizable AI infrastructure with seven different types of NVIDIA-built chips, multiple networking options, and for air and liquid-cooled data centers. Our current focus is on ramping to strong demand, increasing system availability, and providing the optimal mix of configurations to our customer. As Blackwell ramps, we expect gross margins to moderate to the low 70s. When fully ramp, we expect Blackwell margins to be in the mid-70s. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $4.8 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively. We are a data center-scale AI infrastructure company. Our investments include building data centers for development of our hardware and software stacks and to support new introductions. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be an income of approximately $400 million, excluding gains and losses from nonaffiliated investments. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 16.5%, plus or minus 1%, excluding any discrete items. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website. In closing, let me highlight upcoming events for the financial community. We will be attending the UBS Global Technology and AI Conference on December 3 in Scottsdale. Please join us at CES in Las Vegas, where Jensen will deliver a keynote on January 6, and we will host a Q&A session for financial analysts the next day on January 7. Our earnings call to discuss results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 is scheduled for February 26, 2025. We will now open the call for questions. Operator, can you poll for questions, please?

Q3_2025,C.J. Muse,Analyst,"Yeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess just a question for you on the debate around whether scaling for large language models have stalled. Obviously, we're very early here, but would love to hear your thoughts on this front. How are you helping your customers as they work through these issues? And then obviously, part of the context here is we're discussing clusters that have yet to benefit from Blackwell. So, is this driving even greater demand for Blackwell? Thank you.",neutral,0.822672963,Neutral,Neutral,0.1,0.2,0.5,0.15,0.05,Neutral
Q3_2025,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Our foundation model pretraining scaling is intact, and it's continuing. As you know, this is an empirical law, not a fundamental physical law. But the evidence is that it continues to scale. What we're learning, however, is that it's not enough, that we've now discovered two other ways to scale. One is post-training scaling. Of course, the first generation of post-training was reinforcement learning human feedback, but now we have reinforcement learning AI feedback, and all forms of synthetic data generated data that assists in post-training scaling. And one of the biggest events and one of the most exciting developments is Strawberry, ChatGPT o1, OpenAI's o1, which does inference time scaling, what is called test time scaling. The longer it thinks, the better and higher-quality answer it produces. And it considers approaches like chain of thought and multi-path planning and all kinds of techniques necessary to reflect and so on and so forth. And it's -- intuitively, it's a little bit like us doing thinking in our head before we answer your question. And so, we now have three ways of scaling, and we're seeing all three ways of scaling. And as a result of that, the demand for our infrastructure is really great. You see now that at the tail end of the last generation of foundation models were at about 100,000 Hoppers. The next generation starts at 100,000 Blackwells. And so, that kind of gives you a sense of where the industry is moving with respect to pretraining scaling, post-training scaling, and then now very importantly, inference time scaling. And so, the demand is really great for all of those reasons. But remember, simultaneously, we're seeing inference really starting to scale up for our company. We are the largest inference platform in the world today because our installed base is so large. And everything that was trained on Amperes and Hoppers inference incredibly on Amperes and Hoppers. And as we move to Blackwells for training foundation models, it leads behind it a large installed base of extraordinary infrastructure for inference. And so, we're seeing inference demand go up. We're seeing inference time scaling go up. We see the number of AI native companies continue to grow. And of course, we're starting to see enterprise adoption of agentic AI really is the latest rage. And so, we're seeing a lot of demand coming from a lot of different places. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari of Goldman Sachs.

Q3_2025,Toshiya Hari,Analyst,"Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you so much for taking the question. Jensen, you executed the mass change earlier this year. There were some reports over the weekend about some heating issues. On the back of this, we've had investors ask about your ability to execute to the road map you presented at GTC this year with Ultra coming out next year and the transition to Rubin in '26. Can you sort of speak to that? And some investors are questioning that, so if you can sort of speak to your ability to execute on time, that would be super helpful. And then a quick part B. On supply constraints, is it a multitude of componentry that's causing this, or is it specifically HBN? Is it supply constraints? Are the supply constraints getting better? Are they worsening? Any sort of color on that would be super helpful as well. Thank you.",neutral,0.814036369,Neutral,Neutral,0.1,0.2,0.5,0.15,0.05,Neutral
Q3_2025,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah. Thanks. So, let's see. Back to the first question. Blackwell production is in full steam. In fact, as Colette mentioned earlier, we will deliver this quarter more Blackwells than we had previously estimated. And so, the supply chain team is doing an incredible job working with our supply partners to increase Blackwell, and we're going to continue to work hard to increase Blackwell through next year. It is the case that demand exceeds our supply. And that's expected as we're in the beginnings of this generative AI revolution as we all know. And we're at the beginning of a new generation of foundation models that are able to do reasoning and able to do long thinking. And of course, one of the really exciting areas is physical AI, AI that now understands the structure of the physical world. And so, Blackwell demand is very strong. Our execution is going well. And there's obviously a lot of engineering that we're doing across the world. You see now systems that are being stood up by Dell and CoreWeave. I think you saw systems from Oracle stood up. You have systems from Microsoft, and they're about to preview their Grace Blackwell systems. You have systems that are at Google. And so, all of these CSPs are racing to be first. The engineering that we do with them is, as you know, rather complicated. And the reason for that is because, although we build full stack and full infrastructure, we disaggregate all of this AI supercomputer, and we integrate it into all of the custom data centers and architectures around the world. That integration process, it's something we've done several generations now. We're very good at it but still there's still a lot of engineering that happens at this point. But as you see from all of the systems that are being stood up, Blackwell is in great shape. And as we mentioned earlier, the supply and what we're planning to ship this quarter is greater than our previous estimates. With respect to the supply chain, there are seven different chips, seven custom chips that we built in order for us to deliver the Blackwell systems. The Blackwell systems go in air-cooled or liquid-cooled, NVLink 8 or NVLink 72 or NVLink 8, NVLink 36, NVLink 72. We have x86 or Grace. And the integration of all of those systems into the world's data centers is nothing short of a miracle. And so, the component supply chain necessary to ramp at this scale, you have to go back and take a look at how much Blackwell we shipped last quarter, which was zero. And in terms of how much Blackwell total systems will ship this quarter, which is measured in billions, the ramp is incredible. And so almost every company in the world seems to be involved in our supply chain. And we've got great partners, everybody from, of course, TSMC and Amphenol, the connector company, incredible company; Vertiv and SK Hynix and Micron; Spill Amcor; KYEC; and there's Foxconn and the factories that they've built; and Quanta and Wiwynn; and, gosh, Dell and HP, and Super Micro, Lenovo. And the number of companies is just really quite incredible. Quanta. And I'm sure I've missed partners that are involved in the ramping of Blackwell, which I really appreciate. And so, anyways, I think we're in great shape with respect to the Blackwell ramp at this point. And then lastly, your question about our execution of our road map. We're on an annual road map and we're expecting to continue to execute on our annual road map. And by doing so, we increased the performance, of course, of our platform. But it's also really important to realize that when we're able to increase performance and do so at factors at a time, we're reducing the cost of training. We're reducing the cost of inferencing. We're reducing the cost of AI so that it could be much more accessible. But the other factor that's very important to note is that when there's a data center of some fixed size and the data center always is of some fixed size. It could be, of course, tens of megawatts in the past, and now it's -- most data centers are now 100 megawatts to several hundred megawatts, and we're planning on gigawatt data centers, it doesn't really matter how large the data centers are. The power is limited. And when you're in the power-limited data center, the best -- the highest performance per watt translates directly into the highest revenues for our partners. And so, on the one hand, our annual road map reduces costs. But on the other hand, because our perf per watt is so good compared to anything out there, we generate for our customers the greatest possible revenues. And so, that annual rhythm is really important to us, and we have every intention of continuing to do that. And everything is on track as far as I know.

Q3_2025,Timothy Arcuri,Analyst,"Thanks a lot. I'm wondering if you can talk about the trajectory of how Blackwell is going to ramp this year. I know Jensen, you did just talk about Blackwell being better than -- I think you had said several billions of dollars in January. It sounds like you're going to do more than that. But I think in recent months also, you said that Blackwell crosses over Hopper in the April quarter. So, I guess I had two questions. First of all, is that still the right way to think about it, that Blackwell will cross over Hopper in April? And then Colette, you kind of talked about Blackwell bringing down gross margin to the low 70s as it ramps. So, I guess if April is the crossover, is that the worst of the pressure on gross margin? So, you're going to be kind of in the low 70s as soon as April. I'm just wondering if you can sort of shape that for us. Thanks.",neutral,0.688012242,Neutral,Neutral,0.1,0.2,0.5,0.15,0.05,Neutral
Q3_2025,Colette M. Kress,"Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President","Sure. Let me first start with your question, Tim, thank you, regarding our gross margins. And we discussed that our gross margins, as we are ramping Blackwell in the very beginning, and the many different configurations, the many different chips that we are bringing to market, we are going to focus on making sure we have the best experience for our customers as they stand that up. We will start growing into our gross margins, but we do believe those will be in the low 70s in that first program. So, you're correct, as you look at the quarters following after that, we will start increasing our gross margins, and we hope to get to the mid-70s quite quickly as part of that round.",neutral,0.500077307,Neutral,Slightly Positive,0.2,0.45,0.25,0.08,0.02,Slightly Positive
Q3_2025,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Hopper demand will continue through next year, surely the first several quarters of the next year. And meanwhile, we will ship more Blackwells next quarter than this, and we'll ship more Blackwells the quarter after that than our first quarter. And so, that kind of puts it in perspective. We are really at the beginnings of two fundamental shifts in computing that is really quite significant. The first is moving from coding that runs on CPUs to machine learning that creates neural networks that runs on GPUs. And that fundamental shift from coding to machine learning is widespread at this point. There are no companies who are not going to do machine learning. And so, machine learning is also what enables generative AI. And so, on the one hand, the first thing that's happening is $1 trillion worth of computing systems and data centers around the world is now being modernized for machine learning. On the other hand, secondarily, I guess, is that on top of these systems are going to be -- we're going to be creating a new type of capability called AI. And when we say generative AI, we're essentially saying that these data centers are really AI factories. They're generating something. Just like we generate electricity, we're now going to be generating AI. And if the number of customers is large, just as the number of consumers of electricity is large, these generators are going to be running 24/7. And today, many AI services are running 24/7, just like an AI factory. And so, we're going to see this new type of system come online, and I call it an AI factory because that's really as close to what it is. It's unlike a data center of the past. And so, these two fundamental trends are really just beginning. And so, we expect this to happen, this growth, this modernization, and the creation of a new industry to go on for several years.

Q3_2025,Vivek Arya,Analyst,"Thanks for taking my question. Colette, just to clarify, do you think it's a fair assumption to think NVIDIA could recover to kind of mid-70s gross margin in the back half of calendar '25? Just wanted to clarify that. And then Jensen, my main question, historically, when we have seen hardware deployment cycles, they have inevitably included some digestion along the way. When do you think we get to that phase? Or is it just too premature to discuss that because you're just at the start of Blackwell? So, how many quarters of shipments do you think is required to kind of satisfy this first wave? Can you continue to grow this into calendar '26? Just how should we be prepared to see what we have seen historically, right, a period of digestion along the way of a long-term kind of secular hardware deployment?",neutral,0.874843717,Neutral,Neutral,0.1,0.2,0.5,0.15,0.05,Neutral
Q3_2025,Colette M. Kress,"Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President","OK. Vivek, thank you for the question. Let me clarify your question regarding gross margins. Could we reach the mid-70s in the second half of next year? And yes, I think it is a reasonable assumption or goal for us to do, but we'll just have to see how that mix of ramp goes. But yes, it is definitely possible.",neutral,0.733143508,Neutral,Slightly Positive,0.2,0.45,0.25,0.08,0.02,Neutral
Q3_2025,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,"The way to think through that, Vivek, is I believe that there will be no digestion until we modernize $1 trillion with the data centers. Those -- if you just look at the world's data centers, the vast majority of it is built for a time when we wrote applications by hand and we ran them on CPUs. It's just not a sensible thing to do anymore. If you have -- if every company's capex -- if they're ready to build data center tomorrow, they ought to build it for a future of machine learning and generative AI because they have plenty of old data centers. And so, what's going to happen over the course of the next X number of years, and let's assume that over the course of four years, the world's data centers could be modernized as we grow into IT, as you know, IT continues to grow about 20%, 30% a year, let's say. But let's say by 2030, the world's data centers for computing is, call it, a couple of trillion dollars. We have to grow into that. We have to modernize the data center from coding to machine learning. That's number one. The second part of it is generative AI. And we're now producing a new type of capability the world's never known, a new market segment that the world's never had. If you look at OpenAI, it didn't replace anything. It's something that's completely brand new. It's, in a lot of ways as when the iPhone came, was completely brand new. It wasn't really replacing anything. And so, we're going to see more and more companies like that. And they're going to create and generate, out of their services, essentially intelligence. Some of it would be digital artist intelligence like Runway. Some of it would be basic intelligence like OpenAI. Some of it would be legal intelligence like Harvey, digital marketing intelligence like Rider's, so on and so forth. And the number of these companies, these -- what are they called, AI-native companies, are just in hundreds. And almost every platform shift, there was -- there were Internet companies, as you recall. There were cloud-first companies. There were mobile-first companies. Now, they're AI natives. And so, these companies are being created because people see that there's a platform shift, and there's a brand-new opportunity to do something completely new. And so, my sense is that we're going to continue to build out to modernize IT, modernize computing, number one; and then number two, create these AI factories that are going to be for a new industry for the production of artificial intelligence.

Q3_2025,Stacy Rasgon,Analyst,"Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Colette, I had a clarification and a question for you. The clarification, just when you say low 70s gross margins, does 73.5% count as low 70s, or do you have something else in mind? And for my question, you're guiding total revenues, and so I mean, total data center revenues in the next quarter must be up several billion dollars. But it sounds like Blackwell now should be up more than that. But you also said Hopper was still strong, so like is Hopper down sequentially next quarter? And if it is, like why? Is it because of the supply constraints? China has been pretty strong. Is China is kind of rolling off a bit into Q4? So any color you can give us on sort of the Blackwell ramp and the Blackwell versus Hopper behavior into Q4 would be really helpful. Thank you.",neutral,0.755041838,Neutral,Neutral,0.1,0.2,0.5,0.15,0.05,Neutral
Q3_2025,Colette M. Kress,"Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President","So, first, starting on your first question there, Stacy, regarding our gross margin and define low. Low, of course, is below the mids, and let's say we might be at 71%, maybe about 72%, 72.5%. We're going to be in that range. We could be higher than that as well. We're just going to have to see how it comes through. We do want to make sure that we are ramping and continuing that improvement, the improvement in terms of our yields, the improvement in terms of the product as we go through the rest of the year, so we'll get up to the mid-70s by that point. The second statement was a question regarding our Hopper and what is our Hopper doing. We have seen substantial growth for H200 not only in terms of orders but the quickness in terms of those that are standing that out. It is an amazing product and it's the fastest growing and ramping that we've seen. We will continue to be selling Hopper in this quarter, in Q4 for sure. That is across the board in terms of all of our different configurations, and our configurations include what we may do in terms of China. But keep that in mind that folks are also, at the same time, looking to build out their Blackwell. So, we've got a little bit of both happening in Q4. But yes. Is it possible for Hopper to grow between Q3 and Q4? It's possible, but we'll just have to see. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Moore of Morgan Stanley.

Q3_2025,Joseph Moore,Analyst,"Great. Thank you. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the inference market. You've talked about Strawberry and some of the ramifications of longer scaling influence projects. But you've also talked about the possibility that as some of these Hopper clusters age, that you could use some of the Hopper chips for inference. So, I guess do you expect inference to outgrow training in the next kind of 12 months time frame? And just generally, your thoughts there.",neutral,0.890746057,Neutral,Neutral,0.1,0.2,0.5,0.15,0.05,Neutral
Q3_2025,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Our hopes and dreams is that someday, the world does a ton of inference. And that's when AI has really exceeded is when every single company is doing inference inside their companies for the marketing department and forecasting department and supply chain group and their legal department and engineering, of course, and coding of course. And so, we hope that every company is doing inference 24/7 and that there will be a whole bunch of AI native start-ups, thousands of AI native start-ups that are generating tokens and generating AI. And every aspect of your computer experience from using Outlook to PowerPointing or when you're sitting there with Excel, you're constantly generating tokens. And every time you read a PDF, open a PDF, it generated a whole bunch of tokens. One of my favorite applications is NotebookLM, this Google application that came out. I used the living daylights out of it just because it's fun. And I put every PDF, every archived paper into it just to listen to it as well as scanning through it. And so, I think that's the goal is to train these models so that people use it. And there's now a whole new era of AI, if you will, a whole new genre of AI called physical AI. Just those large language models understand the human language and how the thinking process, if you will. Physical AI understands the physical world. And it understands the meaning of the structure and understands what's sensible and what's not and what could happen and what won't. And not only does it understand but it can predict, roll out a short future. That capability is incredibly valuable for industrial AI and robotics. And so, that's fired up so many AI-native companies and robotics companies and physical AI companies that you're probably hearing about. And it's really the reason why we built Omniverse. Omniverse is -- so that we can enable these AIs to be created and learn in Omniverse and learn from synthetic data generation and reinforcement, learning physics feedback. Instead of just a human feedback, it's now physics feedback. To have these capabilities, Omniverse was created so that we can enable physical AI. And so, that -- the goal is to generate tokens. The goal is to inference, and we're starting to see that growth happening. So, I'm super excited about that. Now, let me just say one more thing. Inference is super hard. And the reason why inference is super hard is because you need the accuracy to be high on the one hand. You need the throughput to be high so that the cost could be as low as possible, but you also need the latency to be low. And computers that are high-throughput as well as low latency is incredibly hard to build. And these applications have long context lengths because they want to understand. They want to be able to inference within understanding the context of what they're being asked to do. And so, the context length is growing larger and larger. On the other hand, the models are getting larger. They're multimodality. Just the number of dimensions that inference is innovating is incredible. And this innovation rate is what makes NVIDIA's architecture so great because we -- our ecosystem is fantastic. Everybody knows that if they innovate on top of CUDA and top of NVIDIA's architecture, they can innovate more quickly and they know that everything should work. And if something were to happen, it's probably likely their code and not ours. And so, that ability to innovate in every single direction at the same time, having a large installed base so that whatever you create could land on an NVIDIA computer and be deployed broadly all around the world in every single data center all the way out to the edge into robotic systems, that capability is really quite phenomenal.

And our focus since the beginning of our acquisition of Mellanox has really been about building together the work that we do in terms of in the data center. The networking is such a critical part of that. Our ability to sell our networking with many of our systems that we are doing in data center is continuing to grow and do quite well. So, this quarter is just a slight dip down and we're going to be right back up in terms of growing. We're getting ready for Blackwell and more and more systems that will be using not only our existing networking but also the networking that is going to be incorporated in a lot of these large systems we are providing them to.

Q3_2025,Colette M. Kress,"Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President","So, first, starting in terms of sovereign AI, such an important part of growth, something that is really surfaced with the onset of generative AI and building models in the individual countries around the world. And we see a lot of them, and we talked about a lot of them on the call today and the work that they are doing. So, our sovereign AI and our pipeline going forward is still absolutely intact as those are working to build these foundational models in their own language, in their own culture, and working in terms of the enterprises within those countries. And I think you'll continue to see this be growth opportunities that you may see with our regional clouds that are being stood up and/or those that are focusing in terms of AI factories for many parts of the sovereign AI. This is areas where this is growing not only in terms of in Europe, but you're also seeing this in terms of growth in terms of in the Asia Pac as well. Let me flip to your second question that you asked regarding Gaming. So, our Gaming right now from a supply, we're busy trying to make sure that we can ramp all of our different products. And in this case, our gaming supply, given what we saw selling through was moving quite fast. Now, the challenge that we have is how fast could we get that supply getting ready into the market for this quarter.

And I was wondering if you have a sense like a high-level typical sense of out of an overall AI ecosystem, like maybe one of your clients or one of the large models that are out there today, how much of the compute goes into each of these buckets? How much for the pretraining? How much for the reinforcement? And how much into inference today?

Q3_2025,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Well, today, it's vastly in pretraining a foundation model because, as you know, post-training, the new technologies are just coming online. And whatever you could do in pretraining and post-training, you would try to do so that the inference cost could be as low as possible for everyone. However, there are only so many things that you could do a priority. And so, you'll always have to do on-the-spot thinking and in-context thinking and reflection. And so, I think that the fact that all three are scaling is actually very sensible based on where we are. And in the area foundation model, now we have multimodality foundation models, and the amount of petabytes video that these foundation models are going to be trained on, it's incredible. And so, my expectation is that for the foreseeable future, we're going to be scaling pretraining, post-training, as well as inference time scaling and which is the reason why I think we're going to need more and more compute. And we're going to have to drive as hard as we can to keep increasing the performance by X factors out of time so that we can continue to drive down the cost and continue to increase the revenues and get the AI revolution going.

Q3_2025,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Thank you. The tremendous growth in our business is being fueled by two fundamental trends that are driving global adoption of NVIDIA computing. First, the computing stack is undergoing a reinvention, a platform shift from coding to machine learning, from executing code on CPUs to processing neural networks on GPUs. The $1 trillion installed base of traditional data center infrastructure is being rebuilt for Software 2.0, which applies machine learning to produce AI. Second, the age of AI is in full steam. Generative AI is not just a new software capability but a new industry with AI factories manufacturing digital intelligence, a new industrial revolution that can create a multi-trillion-dollar AI industry. Demand for Hopper and anticipation for Blackwell, which is now in full production, are incredible for several reasons. There are more foundation model makers now than there were a year ago. The computing scale of pretraining and post-training continues to grow exponentially. There are more AI-native start-ups than ever, and the number of successful inference services is rising. And with the introduction of ChatGPT o1, OpenAI o1, a new scaling law called test time scaling has emerged. All of these consume a great deal of computing. AI is transforming every industry, company, and country. Enterprises are adopting agentic AI to revolutionize workflows. Over time, AI coworkers will assist employees in performing their jobs faster and better. Investments in industrial robotics are surging due to breakthroughs in physical AI, driving new training infrastructure demand as researchers train world foundation models on petabytes of video and Omniverse synthetically generated data. The age of robotics is coming. Countries across the world recognize the fundamental AI trends we are seeing and have awakened to the importance of developing their national AI infrastructure. The age of AI is upon us, and it's large and diverse.

Q4_2025,Colette M. Kress,"Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President","Thanks, Stewart. Q4 was another record quarter. Revenue of $39.3 billion was up 12% sequentially and up 78% year on year and above our outlook of $37.5 billion. For fiscal 2025 revenue was $130.5 billion, up 114% from the prior year. Let's start with Data Center. Data center revenue for fiscal 2025 was $115.2 billion, more than doubling from the prior year. In the fourth quarter, Data Center revenue of $35.6 billion was a record, up 16% sequentially and 93% year on year as the Blackwell ramp commenced and Hopper 200 continued sequential growth. In Q4, Blackwell sales exceeded our expectations. We delivered $11 billion of Blackwell revenue to meet strong demand. This is the fastest product ramp in our company's history, unprecedented in its speed and scale. Blackwell production is in full-year across multiple configurations, and we are increasing supply quickly expanding customer adoption. Our Q4 Data Center compute revenue jumped 18% sequentially and over 2x year on year. Customers are racing to scale infrastructure to train the next generation of cutting-edge models and unlock the next level of AI capabilities. With Blackwell, it will be common for these clusters to start with 100,000 GPUs or more. Shipments have already started for multiple infrastructures of this size. Post-training and model customization are fueling demand for NVIDIA infrastructure and software as developers and enterprises leverage techniques such as fine-tuning reinforcement learning and distillation to tailor models for domain-specific use cases. Hugging Face alone hosts over 90,000 derivatives freighted from the Llama foundation model. The scale of post-training and model customization is massive and can collectively demand orders of magnitude, more compute than pretraining. Our inference demand is accelerating, driven by test time scaling and new reasoning models like OpenAI's o3, DeepSeek-R1, and Grok 3. Long-thinking reasoning AI can require 100x more compute per task compared to one-shot inferences. Blackwell was architected for reasoning AI inference. Blackwell supercharges reasoning AI models with up to 25x higher token throughput and 20x lower cost versus Hopper 100. It is revolutionary transformer engine is built for LLM and mixture of experts inference. And its NVLink Domain delivers 14x the throughput of PCIe Gen 5, ensuring the response time, throughput, and cost efficiency needed to tackle the growing complexity of infants of scale. Companies across industries are tapping into NVIDIA's whole STAG inference platform to boost performance and slash costs. Now, tripled inference throughput and cut costs by 66%, using NVIDIA TensorRT for its screenshot feature. Perplexity sees 435 million monthly queries and reduced its inference costs 3x with NVIDIA Triton Inference Server and TensorRT-LLM. Microsoft Bing achieved a 5x speed up at major TCO savings for visual search across billions of images with NVIDIA, TensorRT, and acceleration libraries. Blackwell has great demand for inference. Many of the early GB200 deployments are earmarked for inference, a first for a new architecture. Blackwell addresses the entire AI market from pretraining, post-training to inference across cloud, to on-premise, to enterprise. CUDA's programmable architecture accelerates every AI model and over 4,400 applications, ensuring large infrastructure investments against obsolescence in rapidly evolving markets. Our performance and pace of innovation is unmatched. We're driven to a 200x reduction in inference costs in just the last two years. We delivered the lowest TCO and the highest ROI. And full stack optimizations for NVIDIA and our large ecosystem, including 5.9 million developers continuously improve our customers' economics. In Q4, large CSPs represented about half of our data center revenue. and these sales increased nearly 2x year on year. Large CSPs were some of the first to stand up Blackwell with Azure, GCP, AWS, and OCI bringing GB200 systems to cloud regions around the world to meet certain surging customer demand for AI. Regional cloud hosting NVIDIA GPUs increased as a percentage of data center revenue, reflecting continued AI factory build-outs globally and rapidly rising demand for AI reasoning models and agents. We've launched a 100,000 GB200 cluster-based incidents with NVLink Switch and Quantum 2 InfiniBand. Consumer Internet revenue grew 3x year on year, driven by an expanding set of generative AI and deep learning use cases. These include recommender systems, vision, language understanding, synthetic data generation search, and agentic AI. For example, xAI is adopting the GB200 to train and inference its next generation of Grok AI models. Meta's cutting-edge Andromeda advertising engine runs on NVIDIA's Grace Hopper Superchip serving vast quantities of ads across Instagram, Facebook applications. Andromeda harnesses Grace Hopper's fast interconnect and large memory to boost inference throughput by 3x, enhance ad personalization, and deliver meaningful jumps in monetization and ROI. Enterprise revenue increased nearly 2x year on accelerating demand for model fine-tuning, RAG, and agentic AI workflows, and GPU-accelerated data processing. We introduced NVIDIA Llama Nemotron model family NIMs to help developers create and deploy AI agents across a range of applications including customer support, fraud detection, and product supply chain and inventory management. Leading AI agent platform providers, including SAP and ServiceNow, are among the first to use new models. Health care leaders IQVIA, Illumina, Mayo Clinic, and Arc Institute are using NVIDIA AI to speed drug discovery enhanced genomic research and Pioneer advanced healthcare services with generative and agentic AI. As AI expands beyond the digital world, NVIDIA infrastructure and software platforms are increasingly being adopted to power robotics and physical AI development. One of the early and largest robotics applications and autonomous vehicles where virtually, every AV company is developing on NVIDIA in the data center, the car, or both. NVIDIA's automotive vertical revenue is expected to grow to approximately $5 billion this fiscal year. At CES, Hyundai Motor Group announced it is adopting NVIDIA technologies to accelerate AV and robotics development and smart factory initiatives. Vision transformers, self-supervised learning, multimodal sensor fusion, and high-fidelity simulation are driving breakthroughs in AV development and will require 10x more compute. At CES, we announced the NVIDIA COSMO World Foundation model platform. Just as language, foundation models have revolutionized Language AI, Cosmos is a physical AI to revolutionize robotics. The robotics and automotive companies, including ridesharing giant Uber, are among the first to adopt the platform. From a geographic perspective, sequential growth in our Data Center revenue was strongest in the U.S., driven by the initial ramp up Blackwell. Countries across the globe are building their AI ecosystem as demand for compute infrastructure is surging. France's EUR 100 billion AI investment and the EU's EUR 200 billion invest AI initiatives offer a glimpse into the build-out to set redefined global AI infrastructure in the coming years. Now, as a percentage of total Data Center revenue, data center sales in China remained well below levels seen on the onset of export controls. Absent any change in regulations, we believe that China shipments will remain roughly at the current percentage. The market in China for data center solutions remains very competitive. We will continue to comply with export controls while serving our customers. Networking revenue declined 3% sequentially. Our networking attached to GPU compute systems is robust at over 75%. We are transitioning from small NVLink 8 with InfiniBand, to large NVLink 72 with Spectrum-X. Spectrum-X and NVLink Switch revenue increased and represents a major new growth vector. We expect networking to return to growth in Q1. AI requires a new class of networking. NVIDIA offers NVLink Switch systems for scale-up compute. For scale-out, we offer quantum incentive for HPC supercomputers and Spectrum X for Ethernet environments. Spectrum-X enhances the Ethernet for AI computing and has been a huge success. Microsoft Azure, OCI, CoreWeave, and others are building large AI factories with Spectrum-X. The first Stargate data centers will use Spectrum-X. Yesterday, Cisco announced integrating Spectrum-X into their networking portfolio to help enterprises build AI infrastructure. With its large enterprise footprint and global reach, Cisco will bring NVIDIA Ethernet to every industry. Now, moving to gaming and ARPCs. Gaming revenue of $2.5 billion decreased 22% sequentially and 11% year on year. Full-year revenue of $11.4 billion increased 9% year on year, and demand remains strong throughout the holiday. However, Q4 shipments were impacted by supply constraints. We expect strong sequential growth in Q1 as supply increases. The new GeForce RTX 50 Series desktop and laptop GPUs are here. Build for gamers, creators, and developers they fuse AI and graphics redefining visual computing, powered by the Blackwell architecture, fifth-generation Tensor cores, and fourth-generation RT cores and featuring UQ's400AI tops. These GPUs deliver a 2x performance leap and new AI-driven rendering including neuro shaders, digital human technologies, geometry, and lighting. The new DLSS 4 boost frame rates up to 8x with AI-driven frame generation, turning one rendered frame into three. It also features the industry's first real-time application of transformer models packing 2x more parameters and 4x to compute for unprecedented visual fidelity. We also announced a wave of GeForce Blackwell laptop GPUs with new NVIDIA Max-Q technology that extends battery life by up to an incredible 40%. These laptops will be available starting in March from the world's top manufacturers. Moving to our professional visualization business. Revenue of $511 million was up 5% sequentially and 10% year on year. Full-year revenue of $1.9 billion increased 21% year on year. Key industry verticals driving demand include automotive and healthcare. NVIDIA Technologies and generative AI are reshaping design, engineering, and simulation workloads. Increasingly, these technologies are being leveraged in leading software platforms from ANSYS, Cadence, and Siemens fueling demand for NVIDIA RTX workstations. Now, moving to Automotive. Revenue was a record $570 million, up 27% sequentially and up 103% year on year. Full-year revenue of $1.7 billion increased 5% year on year. Strong growth was driven by the continued ramp in autonomous vehicles, including cars and robotaxis. At CES, we announced Toyota, the world's largest automaker will build its next-generation vehicles on NVIDIA Orin running the safety-certified NVIDIA DriveOS. We announced Aurora and Continental will deploy driverless trucks at scale powered by NVIDIA Drive Thor. Finally, our end-to-end autonomous vehicle platform NVIDIA Drive Hyperion has passed industry safety assessments like TUV SUD and TUV Rheinland, two of the industry's foremost authorities for automotive-grade safety and cybersecurity. NVIDIA is the first AV platform that received a comprehensive set of third-party assessments. OK. Moving to the rest of the P&L. GAAP gross margin was 73% and non-GAAP gross margin was 73.5% and down sequentially as expected with our first deliveries of the Blackwell architecture. As discussed last quarter, Blackwell is a customizable AI infrastructure with several different types of NVIDIA build chips multiple networking options, and for air and liquid-cooled data center. We exceeded our expectations in Q4 in ramping Blackwell, increasing system availability, providing several configurations to our customers. As Blackwell ramps, we expect gross margins to be in the low 70s. Initially, we are focused on expediting the manufacturing of Blackwell systems to meet strong customer demand as they race to build out Blackwell infrastructure. When fully ramped, we have many opportunities to improve the cost, and gross margin will improve and return to the mid-70s, late this fiscal year. Sequentially, GAAP operating expenses were up 9% and non-GAAP operating expenses were 11%, reflecting higher engineering development costs and higher compute and infrastructure costs for new product introductions. In Q4, we returned $8.1 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and cash dividends. Let me turn to the outlook in the first quarter. Total revenue is expected to be $43 billion, plus or minus 2%. Continuing with its strong demand, we expect a significant ramp of Blackwell in Q1. We expect sequential growth in both Data Center and Gaming. Within Data Center, we expect sequential growth from both compute and networking. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 70.6% and 71%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $5.2 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively. We expect full-year fiscal year '26 operating expenses to grow to be in the mid-30s. GAAP and non-GAAP other incoming expenses are expected to be an income of approximately $400 million. excluding gains and losses from nonmarketable and publicly held equity securities. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 17%, plus or minus 1%, excluding any discrete items. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website, including a new financial information AI agent. In closing, let me highlight upcoming events for the financial community. We will be at the TD Cowen Health Care Conference in Boston on March 3 and at the Morgan Stanley Technology, Media, and Telecom Conference in San Francisco on March 5. Please join us for our Annual GTC conference starting Monday, March 17 in San Jose, California. Jensen will deliver a news-packed keynote on March 18, and we will host a Q&A session for our financial analysts for the next day, March 19. We look forward to seeing you at these events. Our earnings call to discuss the results for our first quarter of fiscal 2026 is scheduled for May 28, 2025. We are going to open up the call, operator, to questions. If you could start that, that would be great. Operator Thank you.  And your first question comes from C.J. Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.",positive,0.946353376,Strong Positive,Slightly Positive,0.25,0.4,0.25,0.08,0.02,Strong Positive
Q4_2025,C.J. Muse,Analyst,"Yeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess for me, Jensen, as test-time compute and reinforcement learning shows such promise, we're clearly seeing an increasing blurring of the lines between training and inference. What does this mean for the potential future of potentially inference dedicated clusters? And how do you think about the overall impact to NVIDIA and your customers? Thank you.",neutral,0.787365317,Neutral,Neutral,0.1,0.2,0.5,0.15,0.05,Neutral
Q4_2025,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah, I appreciate that, C.J. There are now multiple scaling laws. There's the pre-training scaling law, and that's going to continue to scale because we have multimodality, we have data that came from reasoning that are now used to do pretraining. And then the second is post-training skilling, using reinforcement learning human feedback, reinforcement learning AI feedback, reinforcement learning, verifiable rewards. The amount of computation you use for post-training is actually higher than pretraining. And it's kind of sensible in the sense that you could, while you're using reinforcement learning, generate an enormous amount of synthetic data or synthetically generated tokens. AI models are basically generating tokens to train AI models. And that's post-trade. And the third part, this is the part that you mentioned is test-time compute or reasoning, long thinking, inference scaling. They're all basically the same ideas. And there, you have a chain of thought, you have search. The amount of tokens generated the amount of inference compute needed is already 100x more than the one-shot examples and the one-shot capabilities of large language models in the beginning. And that's just the beginning. This is just the beginning. The idea that the next generation could have thousands of times and even, hopefully, extremely thoughtful and simulation-based and search-based models that could be hundreds of thousands, millions of times more compute than today is in our future. And so, the question is, how do you design such an architecture? Some of it -- some of the models are auto-regressive. Some of the models are diffusion-based. Some of it -- some of the times you want your data center to have disaggregated inference. Sometimes, it is compacted. And so, it's hard to figure out what is the best configuration of a data center, which is the reason why NVIDIA's architecture is so popular. We run every model. We are great at training. The vast majority of our compute today is actually inference and Blackwell takes all of that to a new level. We designed Blackwell with the idea of reasoning models in mind. And when you look at training, it's many times more performing. But what's really amazing is for long thinking test time scaling, reasoning AI models were tens of times faster, 25x higher throughput. And so, Blackwell is going to be incredible across the board. And when you have a data center that allows you to configure and use your data center based on are you doing more pretraining now, post-training now, or scaling out your inference, our architecture is fungible and easy to use in all of those different ways. And so, we're seeing, in fact, much, much more concentration of a unified architecture than ever before. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.",neutral,0.913692176,Neutral,Slightly Positive,0.2,0.45,0.25,0.08,0.02,Neutral
Q4_2025,Joe Moore,JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst,"Morgan Stanley, actually. Thank you. I wonder if you could talk about GB200 at CES, you sort of talked about the complexity of the rack-level systems and the challenges you have. And then as you said in the prepared remarks, we've seen a lot of general availability. Where are you in terms of that ramp? Are there still bottlenecks to consider at a systems level above and beyond the chip level? And just have you maintained your enthusiasm for the NVL72 platforms?",neutral,0.81535852,Neutral,Neutral,0.1,0.2,0.5,0.15,0.05,Neutral
Q4_2025,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Well, I'm more enthusiastic today than I was at CES. And the reason for that is because we've shipped a lot more since CES. We have some 350 plants manufacturing the 1.5 million components that go into each one of the Blackwell racks, Grace Blackwell racks. Yes, it's extremely complicated. And we successfully and incredibly ramped up Grace Blackwell, delivering some $11 billion of revenues last quarter. We're going to have to continue to scale as demand is quite high, and customers are anxious and impatient to get their Blackwell systems. You've probably seen on the web, a fair number of celebrations about Grace Blackwell systems coming online and we have them, of course. We have a fairly large installation of Grace Blackwell for our own engineering and our own design teams and software teams. CoreWeave has now been quite public about the successful bring-up of theirs. Microsoft has, of course, OpenAI has, and you're starting to see many come online. And so, I think the answer to your question is nothing is easy about what we're doing, but we're doing great, and all of our partners are doing great.

Q4_2025,Vivek Arya,Analyst,"Thank you for taking my question. Colette if you wouldn't mind confirming if Q1 is the bottom for gross margins? And then Jensen, my question is for you. What is on your dashboard to give you the confidence that the strong demand can sustain into next year?

Q4_2025,Colette M. Kress,"Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President","Well, let me first take the first part of the question there regarding the gross margin. During our Blackwell ramp, our gross margins will be in the low 70s. At this point, we are focusing on expediting our manufacturing, expediting our manufacturing to make sure that we can provide to customers as soon as possible. Our Blackwell is fully round. And once it does -- I'm sorry, once our Blackwell fully rounds, we can improve our cost and our gross margin. So, we expect to probably be in the mid-70s later this year. Walking through what you heard Jensen speak about the systems and their complexity, they are customizable in some cases. They've got multiple networking options. They have liquid-cooled and water-cooled. So, we know there is an opportunity for us to improve these gross margins going forward. But right now, we are going to focus on getting the manufacturing complete and to our customers as soon as possible.",neutral,0.523195326,Neutral,Slightly Positive,0.2,0.45,0.25,0.08,0.02,Slightly Positive
Q4_2025,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,"We know several things, Vivek. We have a fairly good line of sight of the amount of capital investment that data centers are building out toward. We know that going forward, the vast majority of software is going to be based on machine learning. And so, accelerated computing and generative AI, reasoning AI are going to be the type of architecture you want in your data center. We have, of course, forecasts and plans from our top partners. And we also know that there are many innovative, really exciting start-ups that are still coming online as new opportunities for developing the next breakthroughs in AI, whether it's agentic AIs, reasoning AI, or physical AIs. The number of start-ups are still quite vibrant and each one of them needs a fair amount of computing infrastructure. And so, I think the -- whether it's the near-term signals or the midterm signals, near-term signals, of course, are POs and forecasts and things like that. Midterm signals would be the level of infrastructure and capex scale-out compared to previous years. And then the long-term signals has to do with the fact that we know fundamentally software has changed from hand-coding that runs on CPUs to machine learning and AI-based software that runs on GPUs and accelerated computing systems. And so, we have a fairly good sense that this is the future of software. And then maybe as you roll it out, another way to think about that is we've really only tapped consumer AI and search and some amount of consumer generative AI, advertising, recommenders, kind of the early days of software. The next wave is coming, agentic AI for enterprise, physical AI for robotics, and sovereign AI as different regions build out their AI for their own ecosystems. And so, each one of these are barely off the ground, and we can see them. We can see them because, obviously, we're in the center of much of this development and we can see great activity happening in all these different places and these will happen. So, near term, midterm, long term. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.",neutral,0.911360145,Neutral,Slightly Positive,0.2,0.45,0.25,0.08,0.02,Slightly Positive
Q4_2025,Harlan Sur,Analyst,"Yeah. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Your next-generation Blackwell Ultra is set to launch in the second half of this year, in line with the team's annual product cadence. Jensen, can you help us understand the demand dynamics for Ultra given that you'll still be ramping the current generation Blackwell solutions? How do your customers and the supply chain also manage the simultaneous ramps of these two products? And is the team still on track to execute Blackwell Ultra in the second half of this year?",neutral,0.771332324,Neutral,Neutral,0.1,0.2,0.5,0.15,0.05,Neutral
Q4_2025,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Yes. Blackwell Ultra is second half. As you know, the first Blackwell was we had a hiccup that probably cost us a couple of months. We're fully recovered, of course. The team did an amazing job recovering and all of our supply chain partners and just so many people helped us recover at the speed of light. And so, now we've successfully ramped production of Blackwell. But that doesn't stop the next train. The next train is on an annual rhythm and Blackwell Ultra with new networking, new memories, and of course, new processors, and all of that is coming online. We have been working with all of our partners and customers, laying this out. They have all of the necessary information, and we'll work with everybody to do the proper transition. This time between Blackwell and Blackwell Ultra, the system architecture is exactly the same. It's a lot harder going from Hopper to Blackwell because we went from an NVLink 8 system to an NVLink 72-based system. So, the chassis, the architecture of the system, the hardware, the power delivery, all of that had to change. This was quite a challenging transition. But the next transition will slot right in Blackwell Ultra will slot right in. We've also already revealed and been working very closely with all of our partners on the click after that. And the click after that is called Vera Rubin and all of our partners are getting up to speed on the transition of that and so preparing for that transition. And again, we're going to provide a big, huge step-up. And so, come to GTC, and I'll talk to you about Blackwell Ultra, Vera Rubin and then show you what we place after that. Really exciting new products to come to GTC piece. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please go ahead.",neutral,0.837860227,Neutral,Slightly Positive,0.2,0.45,0.25,0.08,0.02,Neutral
Q4_2025,Timothy Arcuri,Analyst,"Thanks a lot. Jensen, we heard a lot about custom ASICs. Can you kind of speak to the balance between customer ASIC and merchant GPU? We hear about some of these heterogeneous superclusters to use both GPU and ASIC. Is that something customers are planning on building? Or will these infrastructures remain fairly distinct? Thanks.",neutral,0.890743017,Neutral,Neutral,0.1,0.2,0.5,0.15,0.05,Neutral
Q4_2025,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Well, we built very different things than ASICs, in some ways, completely different in some areas we intercept. We're different in several ways. One, NVIDIA'S architecture is general whether you're -- you've optimized for unaggressive models or diffusion-based models or vision-based models or multimodal models, or text models. We're great in all of it. We're great on all of it because our software stack is so -- our architecture is sensible. Our software stack ecosystem is so rich that we're the initial target of most exciting innovations and algorithms. And so, by definition, we're much, much more general than narrow. We're also really good from the end-to-end from data processing, the curation of the training data, to the training of the data, of course, to reinforcement learning used in post-training, all the way to inference with tough time scaling. So, we're general, we're end-to-end, and we're everywhere. And because we're not in just one cloud, we're in every cloud, we could be on-prem. We could be in a robot. Our architecture is much more accessible and a great target initial target for anybody who's starting up a new company. And so, we're everywhere. And the third thing I would say is that our performance in our rhythm is so incredibly fast. Remember that these data centers are always fixed in size. They're fixed in size or they're fixing power. And if our performance per watt is anywhere from 2x to 4x to 8x, which is not unusual, it translates directly to revenues. And so, if you have a 100-megawatt data center, if the performance or the throughput in that 100-megawatt or the gigawatt data center is four times or eight times higher, your revenues for that gigawatt data center is eight times higher. And the reason that is so different than data centers of the past is because AI factories are directly monetizable through its tokens generated. And so, the token throughput of our architecture being so incredibly fast is just incredibly valuable to all of the companies that are building these things for revenue generation reasons and capturing the fast ROI. And so, I think the third reason is performance. And then the last thing that I would say is the software stack is incredibly hard. Building an ASIC is no different than what we do. We build a new architecture. And the ecosystem that sits on top of our architecture is 10 times more complex today than it was two years ago. And that's fairly obvious because the amount of software that the world is building on top of architecture is growing exponentially and AI is advancing very quickly. So, bringing that whole ecosystem on top of multiple chips is hard. And so, I would say that -- those four reasons. And then finally, I will say this, just because the chip is designed doesn't mean it gets deployed. And you've seen this over and over again. There are a lot of chips that get built, but when the time comes, a business decision has to be made, and that business decision is about deploying a new engine, a new processor into a limited AI factory in size, in power, and in fine. And our technology is not only more advanced, more performance, it has much, much better software capability and very importantly, our ability to deploy is lightning fast. And so, these things are enough for the faint of heart, as everybody knows now. And so, there's a lot of different reasons why we do well, why we win. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes with Melius Research. Please go ahead.",neutral,0.946427166,Neutral,Slightly Positive,0.2,0.45,0.25,0.08,0.02,Strong Positive
Q4_2025,Ben Reitzes,Analyst,"Yeah. Hi. Ben Reitzes here. Hey, thanks a lot for the question. Jensen, it's a geography-related question. You did a great job explaining some of the demand underlying factors here on the strength. But U.S. was up about $5 billion or so sequentially. And I think there is a concern about whether U.S. can pick up the slack if there's regulations toward other geographies. And I was just wondering, as we go throughout the year, if this kind of surge in the U.S. continues and it's going to be -- whether that's OK. And if that underlies your growth rate, how can you keep growing so fast with this mix shift toward the U.S.? Your guidance looks like China is probably up sequentially. So, just wondering if you could go through that dynamic and maybe collect can weigh in. Thanks a lot.",neutral,0.686650693,Neutral,Neutral,0.1,0.2,0.5,0.15,0.05,Neutral
Q4_2025,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,"China is approximately the same percentage as Q4 and as previous quarters. It's about half of what it was before the export control. But it's approximately the same in percentage. With respect to geographies, the takeaway is that AI is software. It's modern software. It's incredible modern software, but it's modern software and AI has gone mainstream. AI is used in delivery services everywhere, shopping services everywhere. If you were to buy a quart of milk, it's delivered to you. AI was involved. And so almost everything that a consumer service provides AIs at the core of it. Every student will use AI as a tutor, healthcare services use AI, financial services use AI. No fintech company will not use AI. Every Fintech company will. Climate tech companies use AI. Mineral discovery now uses AI. The number of -- every higher education, every university uses AI and so I think it is fairly safe to say that AI has gone mainstream and that it's being integrated into every application. And our hope is that, of course, the technology continues to advance safely and advance in a helpful way to society. And with that, we're -- I do believe that we're at the beginning of this new transition. And what I mean by that in the beginning is, remember, behind us has been decades of data centers and decades of computers that have been built. And they've been built for a world of hand coding and general-purpose computing and CPUs and so on and so forth. And going forward, I think it's fairly safe to say that world is going to be almost all software to be infused with AI. All software and all services will be based on -- ultimately, based on machine learning, the data flywheel is going to be part of improving software and services and that the future computers will be accelerated, the future computers will be based on AI. And we're really two years into that journey. And in modernizing computers that have taken decades to build out. And so, I'm fairly sure that we're in the beginning of this new era. And then lastly, no technology has ever had the opportunity to address a larger part of the world's GDP than AI. No software tool ever has. And so, this is now a software tool that can address a much larger part of the world's GDP more than any time in history. And so, the way we think about growth, and the way we think about whether something is big or small has to be in the context of that. And when you take a step back and look at it from that perspective, we're really just in the beginning. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.

Q4_2025,Mark Lipacis,Analyst,"Hi. It's Mark. Thanks for taking the question. I had a clarification and a question. Colette up for the clarification. Did you say that enterprise within the data center grew 2x year on year for the January quarter? And if so, does that -- would that make it the fast faster growing than the hyperscalers? And then, Jensen, for you, the question, hyperscalers are the biggest purchasers of your solutions, but they buy equipment for both internal and external workloads, external workflows being cloud services that enterprise is used. So, the question is, can you give us a sense of how that hyperscaler spend splits between that external workload and internal? And as these new AI workflows and applications come up, would you expect enterprises to become a larger part of that consumption mix? And does that impact how you develop your service, your ecosystem? Thank you.",neutral,0.897444844,Neutral,Neutral,0.1,0.2,0.5,0.15,0.05,Neutral
Q4_2025,Colette M. Kress,"Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President","Sure. Thanks for the question regarding our Enterprise business. Yes, it grew 2x and very similar to what we were seeing with our large CSPs. Keep in mind, these are both important areas to understand. Working with the CSPs can be working on large language models, can be working on inference in their own work. But keep in mind, that is also where the enterprises are servicing. Your enterprises are both with your CSPs as well as in terms of building on their own. They're both growing quite well.",neutral,0.747730672,Neutral,Slightly Positive,0.2,0.45,0.25,0.08,0.02,Slightly Positive
Q4_2025,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,"The CSPs are about half of our business. And the CSPs have internal consumption and external consumption, as you say. And we're using -- of course, used for internal consumption. We work very closely with all of them to optimize workloads that are internal to them because they have a large infrastructure of NVIDIA gear that they could take advantage of. And the fact that we could be used for AI on the one hand, video processing on the other hand, data processing like Spark, we're fungible. And so, the useful life of our infrastructure is much better. If the useful life is much longer, then the TCO is also lower. And so, the second part is how do we see the growth of enterprise or not CSPs, if you will, going forward? And the answer is, I believe, long term, it is by far larger and the reason for that is because if you look at the computer industry today and what is not served by the computer industry is largely industrial. So, let me give you an example. When we say enterprise, and let's use the car company as an example because they make both soft things and hard things. And so, in the case of a car company, the employees will be what we call enterprise and agentic AI and software planning systems and tools, and we have some really exciting things to share with you guys at GTC, build agentic systems are for employees to make employees more productive to design to market plan to operate their company. That's agentic AI. On the other hand, the cars that they manufacture also need AI. They need an AI system that trains the cars, treats this entire giant fleet of cars. And today, there's 1 billion cars on the road. Someday, there will be 1 billion cars on the road, and every single one of those cars will be robotic cars, and they'll all be collecting data, and we'll be improving them using an AI factory. Whereas they have a car factory today, in the future, they'll have a car factory and an AI factory. And then inside the car itself is a robotic system. And so, as you can see, there are three computers involved and there's the computer that helps the people. There's the computer that build the AI for the machineries that could be, of course, could be a tractor, it could be a lawn mower. It could be a human or robot that's being developed today. It could be a building. It could be a warehouse. These physical systems require new type of AI we call physical AI. They can't just understand the meaning of words and languages, but they have to understand the meaning of the world, friction and inertia, object permanence, and cause and effect. And all of those type of things that are common sense to you and I, but AIs have to go learn those physical effects. So, we call that physical AI. That whole part of using agentic AI to revolutionize the way we work inside companies, that's just starting. This is now the beginning of the agentic AI era, and you hear a lot of people talking about it, and we got some really great things going on. And then there's the physical AI after that, and then there are robotic systems after that. And so, these three computers are all brand new. And my sense is that long term, this will be by far the larger of a mall, which kind of makes sense. The world's GDP is representing -- represented by either heavy industries or industrials and companies that are providing for those.

Q4_2025,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah. I appreciate it. First of all, people are still using Voltas and Pascals, and Amperes. And the reason for that is because there are always things that because CUDA is so programmable you could use it Blackwell, one of the major use cases right now is data processing and data curation. You find a circumstance that an AI model is not very good at. You present that circumstance to a vision language model, let's say, it's a car. You present that circumstance to a vision language model. The vision language model actually looks in the circumstances, said, this is what happened and I was very good at it. You then take that response to the prompt, and you go and prompt an AI model to go find in your whole lake of data other circumstances like that, whatever that circumstance was. And then you use an AI to do domain randomization and generate a whole bunch of other examples. And then from that, you can go train the bottle. And so, you could use an peers to go and do data processing and data curation and machine learning-based search. And then you create the training data set, which you then present to your Hopper systems for training. And so, each one of these architectures are completely -- they're all CUDA-compatible and so everything wants on everything. But if you have infrastructure in place, then you can put the less intensive workloads onto the installed base of the past. All of us are very well employed.

Q4_2025,Colette M. Kress,"Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President","Yeah. Thanks for the question. Our gross margins, they're quite complex in terms of the material and everything that we put together in a Blackwell system, a tremendous amount of opportunity to look at a lot of different pieces of that on how we can better improve our gross margins over time. Remember, we have many different configurations as well on Blackwell that will be able to help us do that. So, together, working after we get some of these really strong ramping completed for our customers, we can begin a lot of that work. If not, we're going to probably start as soon as possible if we can. If we can improve it in the short term, we will also do that. Tariff at this point, it's a little bit of an unknown it's an unknown until we understand further what the U.S. government's plan is, both its timing, it's where, and how much. So, at this time, we are awaiting, but again, we would, of course, always follow export controls and/or tariffs in that manner.

Q4_2025,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,"I just wanted to thank you. Thank you, Colette. The demand for Blackwell is extraordinary. AI is evolving beyond perception and generative AI into reasoning. With resenting AI, we're observing another scaling law, inference time or test time scaling, more computation. The more the model thinks the smarter the answer. Models like OpenAI, Grok 3, DeepSeek-R1 are reasoning models that apply inference time scaling. Reasoning models can consume 100x more compute. Future reasoning models can consume much more compute. DeepSeek-R1 has ignited global enthusiasm. It's an excellent innovation. But even more importantly, it has open-sourced a world-class reasoning AI model. Nearly every AI developer is applying R1 or chain of thought and reinforcement learning techniques like R1 to scale their model's performance. We now have three scaling laws, as I mentioned earlier, driving the demand for AI computing. The traditional scaling loss of AI remains intact. Foundation models are being enhanced with multimodality, and pretraining is still growing. But it's no longer enough. We have two additional scaling dimensions: post-training scaling, where reinforcement learning, fine-tuning, model distillation require orders of magnitude more compute than pretraining alone; inference time scaling and reasoning where a single query and demand 100x more compute. We defined Blackwell for this moment, a single platform that can easily transition from pre-trading, post-training, and test time scaling. Blackwell's FP4 transformer engine and NVLink 72 scale-up fabric and new software technologies led Blackwell process reasoning AI models 25 times faster than Hopper. Blackwell in all of this configuration is in full production. Each Grace Blackwell NVLink 72 rack is an engineering marvel. 1.5 million components produced across 350 manufacturing sites by nearly 100,000 factory operators. AI is advancing at light speed. We're at the beginning of reasoning AI and inference time scaling. But we're just at the start of the age of AI, multimodal AIs, enterprise AI sovereign AI and physical AI are right around the corner. We will grow strongly in 2025. Going forward, data centers will dedicate most of capex to accelerated computing and AI. Data centers will increasingly become AI factories, and every company will have either rented or self-operated. I want to thank all of you for joining us today. Come join us at GTC in a couple of weeks. We're going to be talking about Blackwell Ultra, Rubin, and other new computing, networking, reasoning AI, physical AI products, and a whole bunch more.

Q1_2024,Colette Kress,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Thanks, Simona. Q1 revenue was 7.19 billion, up 19% sequentially and down 13% year on year. Strong sequential growth was driven by record data center revenue with our gaming and professional visualization platforms emerging from channel inventory corrections. Starting with data center. Record revenue of 4.28 billion was up 18% sequentially and up 14% year on year on strong growth of our accelerated computing platform worldwide. Generative AI is driving exponential growth in compute requirements and a fast transition to NVIDIA accelerated computing, which is the most versatile, most energy-efficient, and the lowest TCO approach to train and deploy AI. Generative AI drove significant upside in demand for our products, creating opportunities and broad-based global growth across our markets. Let me give you some color across our three major customer categories: Cloud service providers or CSPs, consumer internet companies, and enterprises. First, CSPs around the world are racing to deploy our flagship Hopper and Ampere architecture GPUs to meet the surge in interest from both enterprise and consumer, AI applications for training, and inference. Multiple CSPs announced the availability of H100 on their platforms, including private previews at Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, upcoming offerings at AWS and general availability at emerging GPU specialized cloud providers like CoreWeave and Lambda. In addition to enterprise AI adoption, these CSPs are serving strong demand for H100 from generative AI pioneers. Second, consumer internet companies are also at the forefront of adopting generative AI and deep learning-based recommendation systems, driving strong growth. For example, Meta has now deployed its H100-powered brand Teton AI supercomputer for its AI production and research teams. Third, enterprise demand for AI and accelerated computing is strong. We are seeing momentum in verticals such as automotive, financial services, healthcare, and telecom where AI and accelerated computing are quickly becoming integral to customers' innovation road maps and competitive positioning. For example, Bloomberg announced it has a $50 billion parameter model, BloombergGPT, to help with financial natural language processing tasks such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, news classification, and question answering. Auto insurance company, CCC Intelligence Solutions, is using AI for estimating repairs. And AT&T is working with us on AI to improve fleet dispatches so their field technicians can better serve customers. Among other enterprise customers using NVIDIA AI are Deloitte, for logistics and customer service, and Amgen, for drug discovery and protein engineering. This quarter, we started shipping DGX H100, our Hopper generation AI system, which customers can deploy on-prem. And with the launch of DGX Cloud through our partnership with Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, we deliver the promise of NVIDIA DGX to customers from the cloud. Whether customer -- whether the customers deploy DGX on-prem or via DGX Cloud, they get access to NVIDIA AI software, including NVIDIA-based command, end-to-end AI frameworks, and pretrained models. We provide them with the blueprint for building and operating AI, spanning our expertise across systems, algorithms, data processing, and training methods. We also announced NVIDIA AI Foundations, which are model foundry services available on DGX Cloud that enable businesses to build, refine, and operate custom large language models and generative AI models trained with their own proprietary data, created for unique domain-specific tasks. They include NVIDIA NeMo for large language models; NVIDIA Picasso for images, video, and 3D; and NVIDIA BioNeMo for life sciences. Each service has six elements: pretrained models, frameworks for data processing and curation, proprietary knowledge-based vector databases, systems for fine-tuning, aligning and guardrailing, optimized inference engines, and support from NVIDIA experts to help enterprises fine-tune models for their custom use cases. ServiceNow, a leading enterprise services platform is an early adopter of DGX Cloud and NeMo. They are developing custom large language models trained on data specifically for the ServiceNow platform. Our collaboration will let ServiceNow create new enterprise-grade generative AI offerings with the thousands of enterprises worldwide running on the ServiceNow platform, including for IT departments, customer service teams, employees, and developers. Generative AI is also driving a step function increase in inference workflows. Because of their size and complexities, these workflows require acceleration. The latest MLPerf industry benchmark released in April showed NVIDIA's inference platforms deliver performance that is orders of magnitude ahead of the industry with unmatched versatility across diverse workloads. To help customers deploy generative AI applications at scale, at GTC, we announced four major new inference platforms that leverage the NVIDIA AI software stack. These include L4 Tensor Core GPU for AI video; L40 for Omniverse and graphics rendering, H100 NBL for large language models; and the Grace Hopper Superchip for LLM and also recommendation systems and vector databases. Google Cloud is the first CSP to adopt our L4 inference platform with the launch of its G2 virtual machines for generative AI inference and other workloads, such as Google Cloud Dataproc, Google , Google Alpha Fold and Google Cloud's Immersive Stream, which render 3D and AR experiences. In addition, Google is integrating our Triton Inference Server with Google Kubernetes engine and its cloud-based Vertex AI platform. In networking, we saw strong demand at both CSPs and enterprise customers for generative AI and accelerated computing, which require high-performance networking like NVIDIA's Mellanox networking platforms. Demand relating to general purpose CPU infrastructure remains soft. As generative AI applications grow in size and complexity, high-performance networks become essential for delivering accelerated computing at data center scale to meet the enormous demand of both training and inferencing. Our 400-gig Quantum-2 InfiniBand platform is the gold standard for AI-dedicated infrastructure, with broad adoption across major cloud and consumer internet platforms, such as Microsoft Azure. With the combination of in-network computing technology and the industry's only end-to-end data center scale optimized software stack, customers routinely enjoy a 20% increase in throughput for their sizable infrastructure investment. For multi-tenant cloud transitioning to support generative AI, our high-speed ethernet platform with BlueField-3 DPUs and Spectrum-4 ethernet switching offers the highest available ethernet network performance. BlueField-3 is in production and has been adopted by multiple hyperscale and CSP customers, including Microsoft Azure, Oracle Cloud, CoreWeave, Baidu, and others. We look forward to sharing more about our 400-gig spectrum for accelerated AI networking platform next week at the COMPUTEX conference in Taiwan. Lastly, our Grace data center CPU is sampling with customers. At this week's International Supercomputing Conference in Germany, the University of Bristol announced a new supercomputer based on the NVIDIA Grace CPU superchip, which is 6x more energy efficient than the previous supercomputer. This adds to growing momentum for Grace with both CPU-only and CPU-GPU opportunities across AI and cloud and supercomputing applications. The coming wave of BlueField-3, Grace, and Grace Hopper superchips will enable a new generation of super energy-efficient accelerated data centers. Now, let's move to gaming. Gaming revenue of 2.24 billion was up 22% sequentially and down 38% year on year. Strong sequential growth was driven by sales of the 40 Series GeForce RTX GPUs for both notebooks and desktops. Overall, end demand was solid and consistent with seasonality, demonstrating resilience against a challenging consumer spending backdrop. The GeForce RTX 40 Series GPU laptops are off to a great start, featuring four NVIDIA inventions, RTX path tracing, DLSS 3 AI rendering, Reflex Ultra-low latency rendering, and Max-Q energy-efficient technologies. They deliver tremendous gains in industrial design, performance, and battery life for gamers and creators. Unlike our desktop offerings, 40 Series laptops support the NVIDIA Studio platform for software technologies, including acceleration for creative data science and AI workflows, and Omniverse, giving content creators unmatched tools and capabilities. In desktop, we ramped the RTX 4070, which joined the previously launched RTX 4090, 4080, and the 4070 TI GPUs. The RTX 4070 is nearly 3x faster than the RTX 2070 and offers our large installed base, a spectacular upgrade. Last week, we launched the 60 family, RTX 4060 and 4060 TI, bringing our newest architecture to the world's core gamers starting at just $299. These GPUs, for the first time, provide 2x the performance of the latest gaming console at mainstream price points. The 4060 TI is available starting today, while the 4060 will be available in July. Generative AI will be transformative to gaming and content creation from development to runtime. At the Microsoft Build Developer Conference earlier this week, we showcased how Windows PCs and workstations with NVIDIA RTX GPUs will be AI-powered at their core. NVIDIA and Microsoft have collaborated on end-to-end software engineering, spanning from the Windows operating system to the NVIDIA graphics drivers and NeMo LLM framework to help make Windows on NVIDIA RTX Tensor Core GPUs a supercharged platform for generative AI. Last quarter, we announced a partnership with Microsoft to bring Xbox PC games to GeForce NOW. The first game from this partnership, Gears 5, is now available, with more set to be released in the coming months. There are now over 1,600 games on GeForce NOW, the richest content available on any cloud gaming service. Moving to pro visualization. Revenue of 295 million was up 31% sequentially and down 53% year on year. Sequential growth was driven by stronger workstation demand across both mobile and desktop form factors, with strength in key verticals such as public sector, healthcare, and automotive. We believe the channel inventory correction is behind us. The ramp of our Ada Lovelace GPU architecture in workstations kicks off a major product cycle. At GTC, we announced six new RTX GPUs for laptops and desktop workstations, with further rollouts planned in the coming quarters. Generative AI is a major new workload for NVIDIA-powered workstation. Our collaboration with Microsoft transforms Windows into the ideal platform for creators and designers harnessing generative AI to elevate their creativity and productivity. At GTC, we announced NVIDIA Omniverse Cloud and NVIDIA Fully Managed Service, running in Microsoft Azure, that includes the full suite of Omniverse applications and NVIDIA OVX infrastructure. Using this full stack cloud environment, customers can design, develop, deploy, and manage industrial metaverse applications. NVIDIA Omniverse Cloud will be available starting in the second half of this year. Microsoft NVIDIA will also connect Office365 applications with Omniverse. Omniverse Cloud is being used by companies to digitize the workflows from design and engineering to smart factories and 3D content generation for marketing. The automotive industry has been a leading early adopter of Omniverse, including companies such as BMW Group, Geely Lotus, General Motors and Jaguar Land Rover. Moving to automotive. Revenue was 296 million, up 1% sequentially and up 114% from a year ago. Our strong year-on-year growth was driven by the ramp of the NVIDIA DRIVE Orin across a number of new energy vehicles. As we announced in March, our automotive design win pipeline over the next six years now is down at 14 billion, up from $11 billion a year ago, giving us visibility into continued growth over the coming years. Sequentially, growth moderated as some NAV customers in China are adjusting their production schedules to reflect lower-than-expected demand growth. We expect this dynamic to linger for the rest of the calendar year. During the quarter, we expanded our partnership with BYD, the world's leading manufacturer of NAVs. Our new design win will extend BYD's use of the DRIVE Orin to its next-generation, high-volume Dynasty and Ocean series of vehicles set to start production in calendar 2024. Moving to the rest of the P&L. GAAP gross margins was 64.6%, and non-GAAP gross margins were 66.8%. Gross margins have now largely recovered to prior peak levels as we have absorbed higher costs and offset them by innovating and delivering higher-valued products, as well as products incorporating more and more software. Sequentially, GAAP operating expenses were down 3%, and non-GAAP operating expenses were down 1%. We have held opex at roughly the same level over the last -- past four quarters while working through the inventory corrections in gaming and professional visualization. We now expect to increase investments in the business while also delivering operating leverage. We returned 99 million to shareholders in the form of cash dividends. At the end of Q1, we have approximately 7 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization through December 2023. Let me turn to the outlook for the second quarter of fiscal '24. Total revenue is expected to be 11 billion, plus or minus 2%. We expect this sequential growth to largely be driven by data center, reflecting a steep increase in demand related to generative AI and large language models. This demand has extended our data center visibility out a few quarters, and we have procured substantially higher supply for the second half of the year. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 68.6% and 70%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately 2.71 billion and 1.9 billion, respectively. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be an income of approximately 90 million, excluding gains and losses from nonaffiliated investments. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 14%, plus or minus 1%, excluding any discrete items. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately 300 million to 350 million. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website. In closing, let me highlight some of the upcoming events. Jensen will give the COMPUTEX keynote address in person in Taipei this coming Monday, May 29th, local time, which will be Sunday evening in the U.S. In addition, we will be attending the BofA Global Technology Conference in San Francisco on June 6th, and Rosenblatt Virtual Technology Summit on the Age of AI on June 7th, and the New Street Future of Transportation Virtual Conference on June 12th. Our earnings call to discuss the results of our second quarter of fiscal '24 is scheduled for Wednesday, August 23rd. Well, that covers our opening remarks. We're now going to open the call for questions. Operator, would you please poll for questions? Operator Thank you.  We ask that you please limit yourself to one question. We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. We'll take our first question from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.

Q1_2024,Toshi Hari,Goldman Sachs -- Analyst,"Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you so much for taking the question, and congrats on the strong results and incredible outlook. Just one question on data center. Colette, you mentioned the vast majority of the sequential increase in revenue this quarter will come from data center. I was curious what the construct is there, if you can speak to what the key drivers are from April to July. And perhaps more importantly, you talked about visibility into the second half of the year. I'm guessing it's more of a supply problem at this point. What kind of sequential growth beyond the July quarter can your supply chain support at this point? Thank you.",neutral,0.805173576,Neutral,Slightly Positive,0.15,0.5,0.3,0.04,0.01,Slightly Positive
Q1_2024,Colette Kress,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"OK. So, a lot of different questions there, so let me see if I can start, and I'm sure Jensen will have some following-up comments. So, when we talk about our sequential growth that were expected between Q1 and Q2, our generative AI, large language models are driving this surge in demand. And it's broad-based across both our consumer Internet companies, our CSPs, our enterprises, and our AI start-ups. It is also interest in both of our architectures, both of our Hopper latest architecture, as well as our Ampere architecture. This is not surprising as we generally often sell both of our architectures at the same time. This is also a key area where deep recommendators are driving growth. And we also expect to see growth both in our computing, as well as in our networking business. So, those are some of the key things that we have baked in when we think about the guidance that we have provided to Q2. We also surfaced in our opening remarks that we are working on both supply today for this quarter, but we have also procured a substantial amount of supply for the second half. We have some significant supply chain flow to serve our significant customer demand that we see. And this is demand that we see across a wide range of different customers. They are building platforms for some of the largest enterprises but also setting things up at the CSPs and the large consumer internet companies. So, we have visibility right now for our data center demand that has probably extended out a few quarters. And this led us to working on quickly procuring that substantial supply for the second half. I'm going to pause there and see if Jensen wants to add a little bit more.",neutral,0.693651497,Neutral,Slightly Positive,0.2,0.5,0.25,0.04,0.01,Neutral
Q1_2024,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,"I thought that was great, Colette. Thank you. Operator Next, we'll go to C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.",neutral,0.889079571,Neutral,Neutral,0.1,0.2,0.6,0.08,0.02,Neutral
Q1_2024,C.J. Muse,Evercore ISI -- Analyst,"Yeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. You know, I guess with data center essentially doubling quarter on quarter, two natural kind of questions that relate to one another come to mind. Number one, where are we in terms of driving acceleration into servers to support AI? And as part of that, as you deal with longer cycle times with TSMC and your other partners, how are you thinking about managing their commitments there with where you want to manage your lead times in the coming years to best kind of match that supply and demand? Thanks so much.",neutral,0.827408969,Neutral,Neutral,0.1,0.2,0.6,0.08,0.02,Neutral
Q1_2024,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Yes, C.J. Thanks for the question. I'll start backwards. The -- remember, we were in full production of both Ampere and Hopper when the ChatGPT moment came. And it helped everybody crystallize how to transition from the technology of large language models to a product and service based on a chatbot. The integration of guardrails and alignment systems with reinforcement learning from human feedback, knowledge vector databases for proprietary knowledge, connection to search, all of that came together in a really wonderful way. And it's -- the reason why I call it the iPhone moment, all the technology came together and helped everybody realize what an amazing product it can be and what capabilities it can have. And so, we were already in full production. NVIDIA's supply chain flow and our supply chain is very significant, as you know. And we build supercomputers in volume, and these are giant systems, and we build them in volume. It includes, of course, the GPUs. But on our GPUs, the system boards have 35,000 other components. And the networking and the fiber optics and the incredible transceivers and the NICs, the SmartNICs, the switches, all of that has to come together in order for us to stand up a data center. And so, we were already in full production when that moment came. We had to really significantly increase our procurement substantially for the second half, as Colette said. Now, let me talk about the bigger picture and why the entire world's data centers are moving toward accelerated computing. It's been known for some time, and you've heard me talk about it, that accelerated computing is a full stack problem but -- is full stack challenged. But if you could successfully do it in a large number of application domain that's taken us 15 years, it's sufficiently that almost the entire data centers' major applications could be accelerated, you could reduce the amount of energy consumed and the amount of cost for our data center substantially by an order of magnitude. It costs a lot of money to do it because you have to do all the software and everything, and you have to build all the systems and so on and so forth. But we've been at it for 15 years. And what happened is when generative AI I came along, it triggered a killer app for this computing platform that's been in preparation for some time. And so, now, we see ourselves in two simultaneous transitions: the world's $1 trillion data center is nearly populated entirely by CPUs today. And $1 trillion is $250 billion a year. It's growing, of course. But over the last four years, call it $1 trillion worth of infrastructure installed, and it's all completely based on CPUs and dumb NICs. It's basically unaccelerated. In the future, it's fairly clear now with this -- with generative AI becoming the primary workload of most of the world's data centers generating information, it is very clear now that -- and the fact that accelerated computing is so energy-efficient, that the budget of a data center will shift very dramatically toward accelerated computing, and you're seeing that now. We're going through that moment right now as we speak while the world's data center capex budget is limited. But at the same time, we're seeing incredible orders to retool the world's data centers. And so, I think you're starting -- you're seeing the beginning of, call it, a 10-year transition to basically recycle or reclaim the world's data centers and build it out as accelerated computing. You'll have a pretty dramatic shift in the spend of a data center from traditional computing and to accelerate computing with SmartNICs, smart switches, of course, GPUs and the workload is going to be predominantly generative AI. Operator OK. We'll move to our next question, Vivek Arya with BofA Securities. Your line is open.",neutral,0.895616949,Neutral,Slightly Positive,0.2,0.5,0.25,0.04,0.01,Neutral
Q1_2024,Vivek Arya,Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst,"Thanks for the question. I just wanted to clarify, does visibility mean data center sales can continue to grow sequentially in Q3 and Q4, or do they sustain at Q2 level? So, I just wanted to clarify that. And then, Jensen, my question is that given this very strong demand environment, what does it do to the competitive landscape? Does it invite more competition in terms of custom ASICs? Does it invite more competition in terms of other GPU solutions or other kinds of solutions? What -- how do you see the competitive landscape change over the next two to three years?",neutral,0.849924505,Neutral,Neutral,0.1,0.2,0.6,0.08,0.02,Neutral
Q1_2024,Colette Kress,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Yeah, Vivek. Thanks for the question. Let me see if I can add a little bit more color. We believe that the supply that we will have for the second half of the year will be substantially larger than H1. So, we are expecting, not only the demand that we just saw in this last quarter, the demand that we have in Q2 for our forecast, but also planning on seeing something in the second half of the year. We just have to be careful here, but we're not here to guide on the second half. But yes, we do plan a substantial increase in the second half compared to the first half.",positive,0.660393417,Slightly Positive,Slightly Positive,0.2,0.5,0.25,0.04,0.01,Slightly Positive
Q1_2024,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Regarding competition, we have competition from every direction, start-ups, really, really well funded and innovative start-ups, countless of them all over the world. We have competitions from existing semiconductor companies. We have competition from CSPs with internal projects, and many of you know about most of these. And so, we're mindful of competition all the time, and we get competition all the time. NVIDIA's value proposition at the core is we are the lowest cost solution. We're the lowest TCO solution. And the reason for that is because accelerated computing is two things that I talked about often, which is it's a full stack problem. It's a full stack challenge. You have to engineer all of the software and all the libraries and all the algorithms, integrate them into and optimize the frameworks and optimize it for the architecture of not just one chip but the architecture of an entire data center all the way into the frameworks, all the way into the models. And the amount of engineering and distributed computing -- fundamental computer science work is really quite extraordinary. It is the hardest computing as we know. And so, number one, it's a full stack challenge, and you have to optimize it across the whole thing and across just a mind-blowing number of stacks. We have 400 acceleration libraries. As you know, the amount of libraries and frameworks that we accelerate is pretty mind-blowing. The second part is that generative AI is a large-scale problem and it's a data center scale problem. It's another way of thinking that the computer is the data center or the data center is the computer. It's not the chip, it's the data center. And it's never happened like this before. And in this particular environment, your networking operating system, your distributed computing engines, your understanding of the architecture of the networking gear, the switches, and the computing systems, the computing fabric, that entire system is your computer. And that's what you're trying to operate. And so, in order to get the best performance, you have to understand full stack and understand data center scale. And that's what accelerated computing is. The second thing is that utilization, which talks about the amount of the types of applications that you can accelerate and the versatility of your architecture keeps that utilization high. If you can do one thing and do one thing only incredibly fast, then your data center is largely underutilized, and it's hard to scale that out. NVIDIA's universal GPU, the fact that we accelerate so many of these stacks, makes our utilization incredibly high. And so, number one is steer put, and that's software-intensive problems and data center architecture problem. The second is digitalization versatility problem. And the third, it's just data center expertise. We've built five data centers of our own, and we've helped companies all over the world build data centers. And we integrate our architecture into all the world's clouds. From the moment of delivery of the product to the standing up and the deployment, the time to operations of a data center is measured not -- it can -- if you're not good at it and not proficient at it, it could take months. Standing up a supercomputer -- let's see. Some of the largest supercomputers in the world were installed about 1.5 years ago, and now they're coming online. And so, it's not unheard of to see a delivery to operations of about a year. Our delivery to operations is measured in weeks. And that's -- we've taken data centers and supercomputers, and we've turned it into products. And the expertise of the team in doing that is incredible. And so, our value proposition is in the final analysis. All of this technology translates into infrastructure, the highest throughput and the lowest possible cost. And so, I think our market is, of course, very, very competitive, very large, but the challenge is really, really great. Operator Next, we go to Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.

Q1_2024,Aaron Rakers,Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst,"Yeah. Thank you for taking a question, and congrats on the quarter. As we kind of think about unpacking the various different growth drivers of the data center business going forward, I'm curious, Colette, of just how we should think about the monetization effect of software considering that the expansion of your cloud service agreements continues to grow. I'm curious of what -- where do you think we're at in terms of that approach, in terms of the AI enterprise software suite and other drivers of software-only revenue going forward?",neutral,0.890475154,Neutral,Slightly Positive,0.2,0.5,0.25,0.04,0.01,Neutral
Q1_2024,Colette Kress,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Thanks for the question. Software is really important to our accelerated platforms. Not only do we have a substantial amount of software that we are including in our newest architecture and essentially all products that we have, we're now with many different models to help customers start their work in generative AI and accelerated computing. So, anything that we have here from DGX Cloud on providing those services, helping them build models, or, as you've discussed, the importance of NVIDIA AI Enterprise, essentially, that operating system for AI, so all things should continue to grow as we go forward, both the architecture and the infrastructure, as well as the -- both availability of the software and our ability to monetize that with it as well. I'll turn it over to Jensen if needs to comment.",neutral,0.811477542,Neutral,Slightly Positive,0.2,0.5,0.25,0.04,0.01,Slightly Positive
Q1_2024,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Yes. We can see in real time the growth of generative AI in CSPs, both for training the models, refining the models, as well as deploying the models. As Colette said earlier, inference is now a major driver of accelerated computing because generative AI is used so capably in so many applications already. There are two segments that require a new stack of software, and the two segments are enterprise and industrials. Enterprise requires a new stack of software because many enterprises need to have all the capabilities that we've talked about, whether it's large language models, the ability to adapt them for your proprietary use case, and your proprietary data and alignment to your own principles and your own operating domains. You want to have the ability to be able to do that in a high-performance computing sandbox, and we call that DGX Cloud and -- to create that model. Then, you want to deploy your chatbot or your AI in any cloud because you have services and you have agreements with multiple cloud vendors and depending on the applications, you might deploy it on various clouds. And for the enterprise, we have NVIDIA AI Foundations for helping you create custom models, and we have NVIDIA AI Enterprise. NVIDIA AI Enterprise is the only accelerated stack -- GPU accelerated stack in the world that is enterprise safe and enterprise supported. There are constant patching that you have to do. There are 4,000 different packages that build up NVIDIA AI Enterprise and represents the operating engine -- end-to-end operating engine of the entire AI workflow. It's the only one of its kind from data ingestion, data processing. Obviously, in order to train an AI model, you have a lot of data you have to process and package up and curate and align. And there's just a whole bunch of stuff that you have to do to the data to prepare it for training. That amount of data could consume some 40%, 50%, 60% of your computing time. And so, data processing is a very big deal. And then, the second aspect of it is training the model, refining the model. And the third is deploying model for inferencing.NVIDIA AI Enterprise supports and patches and security patches continuously all of those 4,000 packages of software. And for an enterprise that wants to deploy their engines just like they want to deploy Red Hat Linux, this is incredibly complicated software. In order to deploy that in every cloud and as well as on-prem, it has to be secure. It has to be supported. And so, NVIDIA AI Enterprise is the second part. The third is Omniverse. Just as people are starting to realize that you need to align an AI to ethics, the same for robotics. You need to align the AI for physics, and aligning an AI for ethics includes a technology called reinforcement learning human feedback. In the case of industrial applications and robotics, it's reinforcement learning Omniverse feedback. And Omniverse is a vital engine for software-defined and robotic applications and industries. And so, Omniverse also needs to be a cloud service platform. And so, our software stack, the three software stacks, AI Foundations, AI Enterprise, and Omniverse, runs in all of the world's clouds that we have partnerships, DGX Cloud partnerships with. Azure, we have partnerships on both AI, as well as Omniverse. With GCP and Oracle, we have great partnerships in DGX Cloud for AI, and AI Enterprise is integrated into all three of them. And so, I think the -- in order for us to extend the reach of AI beyond the cloud and into the world's enterprise and into the world's industries, you need two new types of -- you need new software stacks in order to make that happen. And by putting it in the cloud, integrated into the world CSP clouds, it's a great way for us to partner with the sales and the marketing team and the leadership team of all the cloud vendors.

Q1_2024,Tim Arcuri,UBS -- Analyst,"Thanks a lot. I had a question, and then, I have a clarification as well. So, the question, first, is, Jensen, on the InfiniBand versus ethernet argument, can you sort of speak to that debate and maybe how you see it playing out? I know you need the low latency of InfiniBand for AI. But can you sort of talk about the attach rate of your InfiniBand solutions to what you're shipping on the core compute side and maybe whether that's similarly crowding out ethernet like you are with -- on the compute side? And then the clarification, Colette, is that there wasn't a share buyback despite you still having about $7 billion on the share repo authorization. Was that just timing?

Thank you.",neutral,0.750576019,Neutral,Neutral,0.1,0.2,0.6,0.08,0.02,Neutral
Q1_2024,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,"InfiniBand and ethernet are -- target different applications in a data center. They both have their place. InfiniBand had a record quarter. We're going to have a giant record year. And InfiniBand has a really -- NVIDIA's Quantum InfiniBand has an exceptional road map. It's going to be really incredible. The two networks are very different. InfiniBand is designed for an AI factory, if you will. If that data center is running a few applications for a few people for a specific use case and is doing it continuously, and that infrastructure costs you, pick a number, $500 million. The difference between InfiniBand and ethernet could be 15%, 20% in overall throughput. And if you spent $500 million on an infrastructure and the difference is 10% to 20%, and it's $100 million, InfiniBand's basically free. That's the reason why people use it. InfiniBand is effectively free. The difference in data center throughput is just -- it's too great to ignore. And you're using it for that one application. And so -- however, if your data center is a cloud data center and it's multi-tenant, it's a bunch of little jobs, a bunch of little jobs and is shared by millions of people, then ethernet is really the right answer. There's a new segment in the middle where the cloud is becoming a generative AI cloud. It's not an AI factory per se, but it's still a multi-tenant cloud, but it wants to run generative AI workloads. This new segment is a wonderful opportunity. And at COMPUTEX -- I referred to it at the last GTC. At COMPUTEX, we're going to announce a major product line for this segment, which is for ethernet-focused generative AI application type of clouds. But InfiniBand is doing fantastically, and we're doing record numbers quarter on quarter, year on year.

Q1_2024,Stacy Rasgon,Bernstein Research -- Analyst,"Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I had a question on inference versus training for generative AI. So, you're talking about inference as being a very large opportunity. I guess two subparts of that. Is that because inference basically scales with like the usage versus like training is more of a one and done? And can you give us some sort of -- even if it's just like qualitatively, like do you think inference is bigger than training or vice versa? Like if it's bigger, how much bigger? Is it like the opportunity, is it 5x? Is it 10x? Is there anything you can give us on those two workloads within generative AI, would be helpful?",neutral,0.914981306,Neutral,Slightly Positive,0.2,0.5,0.25,0.04,0.01,Neutral
Q1_2024,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah. I'll work backwards. You're never done with training. You're always -- every time you deploy, you're collecting new data. When you collect new data, you train with the new data. And so, you're never done training. You're never done producing and processing a vector database that augments the large language model. You're never done with vectorizing all of the collected structured, unstructured data that you have. And so, whether you're building a recommender system, a large language model, a vector database, these are probably the three major applications of -- the three core engines, if you will, of the future of computing, as well as a bunch of other stuff. But obviously, these are very -- three very important ones. They are always, always running. You're going to see that more and more companies realize they have a factory for intelligence -- an intelligence factory. And in that particular case, it's largely dedicated to training and processing data and vectorizing data and learning representation of the data, so on and so forth. The inference part of it are APIs that are either open APIs that can be connected to all kinds of applications, APIs that are integrated into workflows but APIs of all kinds. There will be hundreds of APIs in a company. Some of them, they built themselves. Some of them, part that -- many of them could come from companies like ServiceNow and Adobe that we're partnering with in AI Foundations. And they'll create a whole bunch of generative AI APIs that companies can then connect into their workflows or use as an application. And, of course, there'll be a whole bunch of internet service companies. And so, I think you're seeing for the very first time, simultaneously, a very significant growth in the segment of AI factories, as well as a market that -- a segment that really didn't exist before but now it's growing exponentially, practically by the week, for AI inference with APIs. The simple way to think about it in the end is that the world has a $1 trillion of data center installed, and it used to be 100% CPUs. In the future, we know -- we've heard it in enough places, and I think this year's ISC keynote was actually about the end of Moore's Law. We've seen it in a lot of places now that you can't reasonably scale out data centers with general purpose computing and that accelerated computing is the path forward. And now, it's got a killer app. It's called generative AI. And so, the easiest way to think about that is your $1 trillion infrastructure. Every quarter's capital, capex budget would lean very heavily into generative AI, into accelerated computing infrastructure, everywhere from the number of GPUs that would be used in the capex budget to the accelerated switches and accelerated networking chips that connect them all. The easiest way to think about that is, over the next four, five, 10 years, most of that $1 trillion and then compensating, adjusting for all the growth in data center still, it will be largely generative AI. And so, that's probably the easiest way to think about that, and that's training as well as inference. Operator Good. Next, we'll go to Joseph Moore with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.",neutral,0.915298283,Neutral,Slightly Positive,0.2,0.5,0.25,0.04,0.01,Neutral
Q1_2024,Joe Moore,Morgan Stanley -- Analyst,Great. Thank you. I wanted to follow up on that in terms of the focus on inference. It's pretty clear that this is a really big opportunity around large language models. But the cloud customers are also talking about trying to reduce cost per query by very significant amounts. Can you talk about the ramifications of that for you guys? Is that where some of the specialty inference products that you launched at GTC come in? And just how are you going to help your customers get the cost per query down?,neutral,0.825459063,Neutral,Slightly Positive,0.2,0.5,0.25,0.04,0.01,Neutral
Q1_2024,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah. That's a great question. Whether you're -- whether -- you start by building a large language model, and you use that large language model, very large version, and you could distill them into medium, small, and tiny size. And the tiny sized ones, you could put in your phone and your PC and so on and so forth. And they all have good -- they all have -- it seems surprising, but they all can do the same thing. But obviously, the zero shot or the generalizability of the large language model, the biggest one is much more versatile, and it can do a lot more amazing things. And the large one would teach the smaller ones how to be good AIs, and so you use the large one to generate prompts to align the smaller ones and so on and so forth. And so, you start by building very large ones, and then you also have to train a whole bunch of smaller ones. That's exactly the reason why we have so many different sizes of our inference. You saw that I announced L4, L40, H100 NVL, which also has H100. And then, it has -- and then, we have H100 HGX, and then we have H100 multinode with NVLink. And so, there's a -- you could have model sizes of any kind that you like. The other thing that's important is these are models, but they're connected ultimately to applications. And the applications could have image in, video out, video in, text out, image in, proteins out, text in, 3D out, video in, in the future, 3D graphics out. So, the input and the output requires a lot of pre and postprocessing. The pre and postprocessing can't be ignored. And this is one of the things that most of the specialized chip arguments fall apart. And it's because the length -- the model itself is only, call it, 25% of the data -- of the overall processing of inference. The rest of it is about preprocessing, postprocessing, security, decoding, all kinds of things like that. And so, I think the -- we -- the multi-modality aspect of inference, the multidiversity of inference that it's going to be done in the cloud on-prem, it's going to be done in multi-cloud. That's the reason why we have AI Enterprise in all the clouds. It's going to be done on-prem. It's the reason why we have a great partnership with Dell we just announced the other day called Project Helix. That's going to be integrated into third-party services. That's the reason why we have a great partnership with ServiceNow and Adobe because they're going to be creating a whole bunch of generative AI capabilities. And so, there's a -- the diversity and the reach of generative AI is so broad, you need to have some very fundamental capabilities like what I just described in order to really address the whole space of it.

Q1_2024,Harlan Sur,JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst,"Hi. Good afternoon, and congratulations on the strong results and execution. I really appreciate more of the focus or some of the focus today on your networking products. I mean, it's really an integral part to sort of maximize the full performance of your compute platforms. I think your data center networking business is driving about $1 billion of revenues per quarter, plus or minus. That's 2.5x growth from three years ago, right, when you guys acquired Mellanox, so very strong growth. But given the very high attach of your InfiniBand ethernet solutions, your accelerated compute platforms, is the networking run rate stepping up in line with your compute shipments? And then, what is the team doing to further unlock more networking bandwidth going forward just to keep pace with the significant increase in compute complexity, data sets, requirements for lower latency, better traffic predictability and so on?",positive,0.739743054,Slightly Positive,Slightly Positive,0.2,0.5,0.25,0.04,0.01,Slightly Positive
Q1_2024,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah. Harlan, I really appreciate that. Nearly everybody who thinks about AI, they think about that chip, that accelerator chip. And in fact, this is the whole point nearly completely. And I've mentioned before that accelerated computing is about the stack, about the software. And networking, remember, we announced very, very early on this networking stack called DOCA, and we have an acceleration library called Magnum IO. These two pieces of software are some of the crown jewels of our company. Nobody ever talks about it because it's hard to understand, but it makes it possible for us to connect tens of thousands of GPUs. How do you connect tens of thousands of GPUs if the operating system of the data center, which is the infrastructure, is not insanely great? And so, that's the reason why we're so obsessed about networking in the company. And one of the great things that we have, we have Mellanox, as you know quite well, was the world's highest performance and the unambiguous leader in high-performance networking. It's the reason why our two companies are together. You also see that our network expands starting from NVLink, which is a computing fabric with really super low latency, and it communicates using memory references, not network packaged. And then, we take NVLink. We connect it inside multiple GPUs, and I've described going beyond the GPU. And I'll talk a lot more about that at COMPUTEX in a few days. And then that gets connected to InfiniBand, which includes the NIC and the SmartNIC, BlueField-3 that we're in full production with and the switches. All of the fiber optics that are optimized end to end, these things are running at incredible line rates. And then, beyond that, if you want to connect the smart AI factory -- this AI factory into your computing fabric, we have a brand-new type of ethernet that we'll be announcing at COMPUTEX. And so the -- this whole area of the computing fabric extending -- connecting all of these GPUs and computing units together all the way through the networking, through the switches, the software stack is insanely complicated. And so, we're -- I'm delighted you understand it, and -- but we don't break it out particularly because we think of the whole thing as a computing platform as it should be. We sell it to all of the world's data centers as components so that they can integrate it into whatever style or architecture that they would like and we can still run our software stack. That's the reason why we break it up. It's way more complicated the way that we do it, but it makes it possible for NVIDIA's computing architecture to be integrated into anybody's data center in the world from cloud of all different kinds to on-prem of all different kinds, all the way out to the edge to 5G. And so, this way of doing it is really, really complicated, but it gives us incredible reach. Operator And our last question will come from Matt Ramsay with TD Cowen.

You guys have been working on this for some time behind the scenes, where you sell in the hardware to your hyperscale partners and then lease it back for your own business. And the rest of us kind of found out about it publicly a few months ago. And as we look forward over the next number of quarters, as Colette discussed, the high visibility in the data center business, maybe you could talk a little bit about the mix you're seeing of hyperscale customers buying for their own first-party internal workloads versus their own sort of third party, their own customers versus what of that big upside in data center going forward is systems that you're selling in with potential to support your DGX Cloud offerings and what you've learned since you've launched it about the potential of that business.

Q1_2024,"Yeah. Thanks, Matt. It's","without being too specific about numbers, but the ideal scenario, the ideal mix is something like 10% NVIDIA DGX Cloud and 90% the CSPs' clouds. And the reason -- and our DGX Cloud is the NVIDIA stack.","It's the pure NVIDIA stack. It is architected the way we like and achieves the best possible performance. It gives us the ability to partner very deeply with the CSPs to create the highest-performing infrastructure, number one. Number two, it allows us to partner with the CSPs to create markets. Like for example, we're partnering with Azure to bring Omniverse Cloud to the world's industries. And the world has never had a system like that, the computing stack with all the generative AI stuff and all the 3D stuff and the physics stuff, incredibly large database and really high-speed networks and low-latency networks. That kind of a virtual -- industrial virtual world has never existed before. And so, we partnered with Microsoft to create Omniverse Cloud inside Azure Cloud. And so, it allows us, number two, to create new applications together and develop new markets together. And we go to market as one team. And we benefit by getting customers on our computing platform, and they benefit by having us in their cloud, number one. But number two, the amount of data and services and security services and all of the amazing things that Azure and GCP and OCI have, they can instantly have access to that through Omniverse Cloud. And so, it's a huge win-win. And for the customers, the way that NVIDIA's cloud works for these early applications, they could do it anywhere. So, one standard stack runs in all the clouds. And if they would like to take their software and run it on the CSP's cloud themselves and manage it themselves, we're delighted by that because NVIDIA AI Enterprise, NVIDIA AI Foundations, and long term, this is going to take a little longer, but NVIDIA Omniverse will run in the CSP's clouds. OK? So, our goal really is to drive architecture, to partner deeply in creating new markets and the new applications that we're doing and provide our customers with the flexibilities to run NVIDIA everywhere, including on-prem. And so, that -- those were the primary reasons for it. And it's worked out incredibly. Our partnership with the three CSPs and that we currently have DGX Cloud in and their sales force and marketing teams, their leadership teams is really quite spectacular. It works great.

CPU scaling has slowed, yet computing demand is strong, and now, with generative AI, supercharged. Accelerated computing, a full stack and data center scale approach that NVIDIA pioneered is the best path forward. There's $1 trillion installed in the global data center infrastructure based on the general purpose computing method of the last era. Companies are now racing to deploy accelerated computing for the generative AI era. Over the next decade, most of the world's data centers will be accelerated. We are significantly increasing our supply to meet their surging demand. Large language models can learn information encoded in many forms. Guided by large language models, generative AI models can generate amazing content with models to fine-tune, guardrail, align to guiding principles. And ground -- ground to facts, generative AI is emerging from labs and is on its way to industrial applications. As we scale with cloud and internet service providers, we are also building platforms for the world's largest enterprises.

Q2_2024,Colette Kress,"Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Simona. We had an exceptional quarter. Record Q2 revenue of 13.51 billion was up 88% sequentially and up 101% year on year and above our outlook of 11 billion. Let me first start with data center. Record revenue of 10.32 billion was up 141% sequentially and up 171% year on year. Data center compute revenue nearly tripled year on year driven primarily by accelerating demand for cloud from cloud service providers and large consumer internet companies for our HGX platform, the engine of generative and large language models. Major companies including AWS, Google Cloud, Meta, Microsoft Azure, and Oracle Cloud, as well as a growing number of GPU cloud providers are deploying in-volume HGX systems based on our Hopper and Ampere architecture tensor core GPUs. Networking revenue almost doubled year on year driven by our end-to-end InfiniBand networking platform, the gold standard for AI. There is tremendous demand for Nvidia accelerated computing and AI platforms. Our supply partners have been exceptional in ramping capacity to support our needs. Our data center supply chain, including HGX, with 35,000 parts and highly complex networking, has been built up over the past decade. We have also developed and qualified additional capacity and suppliers for key steps in the manufacturing process such as co-op packaging. We expect supply to increase each quarter through next year. By geography, data center growth was strongest in the U.S. as customers direct their capital investments to AI and accelerated computing. China's demand was within the historical range of 20% to 25% of our data center revenue, including compute and networking solutions. At this time, let me take a moment to address recent reports on the potential for increased regulations on our exports to China. We believe the current regulation is achieving the intended results. Given the strength of demand for our products worldwide, we do not anticipate that additional export restrictions on our data center GPUs, if adopted, would have an immediate material impact to our financial results. However, over the long term, restrictions prohibiting the sale of our data center GPUs to China, if implemented, will result in a permanent loss of an opportunity for the U.S. industry to compete and lead in one of the world's largest markets. Our cloud service providers drove exceptional strong demand for HGX systems in the quarter as they undertake a generational transition to upgrade their data center infrastructure for the new era of accelerated computing and AI. The NVIDIA HGX platform is culminating of nearly two decades of full-stack innovation across silicon, systems, interconnects, networking, software, and algorithms. Instances powered by the NVIDIA H100 tensor core GPUs are now generally available at AWS, Microsoft Azure, and several GPU cloud providers, with others on the way shortly. Consumer internet companies also drove the very strong demand. Their investments in data center infrastructure purpose-built for AI are already generating significant returns. For example, Meta recently highlighted that, since launching reels and AI recommendations, have driven a more than 24% increase in time spent on Instagram. Enterprises are also racing to deploy generative AI, driving strong consumption of Nvidia-powered instances in the cloud, as well as demand for on-premise infrastructure. Whether we serve customers in the cloud or on-prem through partners or direct, their applications can run seamlessly on Nvidia AI Enterprise software with access to our acceleration libraries, pre-trained models, and APIs. We announced a partnership with Snowflake to provide enterprises with accelerated paths to create customized generative AI applications using their own proprietary data, all securely within the Snowflake data cloud. With the NVIDIA NeMo platform for developing large language models, enterprises will be able to make custom LLMs for advanced AI services, including chatbots, search, and summarization right from the Snowflake data cloud. Virtually every industry can benefit from generative AI. For example, AI co-pilot, such as those just announced by Microsoft, can boost the productivity of over a billion office workers and tens of millions of software engineers. Millions of professionals in legal services, sales, customer support, and education will be available to leverage AI systems trained in their fields. And the co-pilots and assistants are set to create new multi-hundred billion dollars market opportunities for our customers. We are seeing some of the earliest applications of generative AI in marketing, media, and entertainment. WPP, the world's largest marketing and communication services organization, is developing a content engine using Nvidia Omniverse to enable artists and designers to integrate generative AI into 3D content creation. WPP designers can create images from text prompts while responsibly train generative AI tools and content from Nvidia partners such as Adobe and Getty Images using NVIDIA Picasso, a foundry for custom generative AI models for visual design. Visual content provider Shutterstock is also using NVIDIA Picasso to build tools and services that enable users to create 3D scene backgrounds with the help of generative AI. We partnered with ServiceNow and Accenture to launch the AI Lighthouse program, fast-tracking the development of enterprise AI capabilities. AI Lighthouse unites the ServiceNow enterprise automation platform and engine with Nvidia accelerated computing and with Accenture consulting and deployment services. We are collaborating also with Hugging Face to simplify the creation of new and custom AI models for enterprises. Hugging Face will offer a new service for enterprises to train and tune advanced AI models powered by NVIDIA DGX Cloud. And just yesterday, VMware and Nvidia announce a major new enterprise offering called VMware Private AI Foundation with Nvidia, a fully integrated platform featuring AI software and accelerated computing from Nvidia, with multi-cloud software for enterprises running VMware. VMware's hundreds of thousands of enterprise customers will have access to the infrastructure, AI, and cloud management software needed to customize models and run generative AI applications such as intelligent chatbot assistance, search, and summarization. We also announced new NVIDIA AI Enterprise-ready servers featuring the new NVIDIA L40S GPU built for the industry-standard data center server ecosystem and BlueField-3 DPU data center infrastructure processor. L40S is not limited by co-op supply and is shipping to the world's leading server system makers. L40S is a universal data center processor designed for high-volume data center scaling out to accelerate the most compute-intensive applications including AI training and , 3D design and visualization, video processing, and NVIDIA Omniverse industrial digitalization. NVIDIA AI Enterprise-ready servers are fully optimized for VMware Cloud Foundation and Private AI Foundation. Nearly 100 configurations of NVIDIA AI Enterprise-ready servers will soon be available from the world's leading enterprise IT computing companies including Dell, HPE, and Lenovo. The GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip, which combines our Arm-based Grace CPU with Hopper GPU, entered full production and will be available this quarter in OEM servers. It is also shipping to multiple supercomputing customers including Los Alamos National Labs and the Swiss National Computing Centre. And Nvidia and SoftBank are collaborating on a platform based on GH200 for generative AI and 5G/6G applications. The second-generation version of our Grace Hopper Superchip with the latest HBM GPU memory will be available in Q2 of calendar 2024. We announced the DGX GH200, a new class of large memory AI supercomputer for giant AI language models, recommender systems, and data analytics. This is the first use of the new NVIDIA NVLink Switch System enabling all of its 256 Grace Hopper superchips to work together as one, a huge jump compared to our prior generation connecting just eight GPUs on NVIDIA Link. DGX GH200 systems are expected to be available by the end of the year, Google Cloud, Meta, and Microsoft among the first to gain access. Strong networking growth was driven primarily by InfiniBand infrastructure to connect HGX GPU systems. Thanks to its end-to-end optimization and in-network computing capabilities, InfiniBand delivers more than double the performance of traditional Ethernet for AI. For billions-of-dollar AI infrastructures, the value from the increased throughput of InfiniBand is worth hundreds of millions and pays for the network. In addition, only InfiniBand can scale to hundreds of thousands of GPUs. It is the network of choice for leading AI practitioners. For Ethernet-based cloud data centers that seek to optimize their AI performance, we announced NVIDIA Spectrum-X, an accelerated networking platform designed to optimize Ethernet for AI workloads. Spectrum-X couples the spectrum for the Ethernet switch with the BlueField-3 DPU, achieving 1.5x better overall AI performance and power efficiency versus traditional Ethernet. BlueField-3 DPU is a major success. It is in qualification with major OEMs and ramping across multiple CSP and consumer internet companies. Now, moving to gaming. Gaming revenue of 2.49 billion was up 11% sequentially and 22% year on year. Growth was fueled by GeForce RTX 40 series GPUs for laptops and desktops, and customer demand was solid and consistent with seasonality. We believe global end demand has returned to growth after last year's slowdown. We have a large upgrade opportunity ahead of us, just 47% of our installed base have upgraded to RTX, and about 20% of a GPU with an RTX 3060 or higher performance. Laptop GPUs posted strong growth in the key back-to-school season led by RTX 4060 GPUs. Nvidia's GPU-powered laptops have gained in popularity, and their shipments are now outpacing desktop GPUs in several regions around the world. This is likely to shift the reality of our overall gaming revenue again with Q2 and Q3 as the stronger quarters of the year, reflecting the back-to-school and holiday build schedules for laptops. In desktop, we launched the GeForce RTX 4060 and the GeForce RTX 4060 Ti GPUs, bringing the Ada Lovelace architecture down to price points as low as $299. The ecosystem of RTX and DLSS games continued to expand, 35 new games added to DLSS support including blockbusters such as Diablo 4 and Baldur's Gate 3. There's now over 330 RTX accelerated games and apps. We are bringing generative AI to games. At Computex, we announced NVIDIA Avatar Cloud Engine  for games, a custom AI model foundry service. Developers can use the service to bring intelligence to nonplayer characters. It harnesses a number of NVIDIA Omniverse and AI technologies including NeMo Riva and Audio2Face. Now moving to professional visualization. Revenue of 375 million was up 28% sequentially and down 24% year on year. The Ada architecture ramp drove strong growth in Q2, rolling out initially in laptop workstations, with a refresh of desktop workstations coming in Q3. These will include powerful new RTX systems with up to four NVIDIA RTX 6000 GPUs, providing more than 5,800 teraflops of AI performance and 192 gigabytes of GPU memory. They can be configured with NVIDIA AI Enterprise or NVIDIA Omniverse Enterprise. We also announced three new desktop workstation GPUs based on the Ada generation, the NVIDIA RTX 5000, 4500, and 4000, offering up to 2x the RT core throughput and up to 2x faster AI training performance compared to the previous generation. In addition to traditional workloads such as 3D design and content creation, new workloads and generative AI, large language model development, and data science are expanding the opportunities in pro visualization for our RTX technology. One of the key themes in Jensen's keynote at SIGGRAPH earlier this month was the convergence of graphics and AI. This is where NVIDIA Omniverse is positioned. Omniverse is OpenUSD data platform. OpenUSD is a universal interchange that is quickly becoming the standard for the 3D world, much like HTML is the universal language for 2D content. Together, Adobe, Apple, Autodesk, Pixar, and Nvidia formed the Alliance for OpenUSD. Our mission is to accelerate OpenUSD development and adoption. We announced new and upcoming Omniverse Cloud APIs, including RunUSD and ChatUSD to bring generative AI to OpenUSD workloads. Moving to automotive. Revenue was 253 million, down 15% sequentially and up 15% year on year. Solid year-on-year growth was driven by the ramp of self-driving platforms based on NVIDIA DRIVE Orin SoC with a number of new energy vehicle makers. The sequential decline reflects lower overall automotive demand, particularly in China. We announced a partnership with MediaTek to bring drivers and passengers new experiences inside the car. MediaTek will develop automotive SoCs and integrate a new product line of NVIDIA GPU chipsets. The partnership covers a wide range of vehicle segments from luxury to entry-level. Moving to the rest of the P&L. GAAP gross margins expanded to 70.1% and non-GAAP gross margin to 71.2% driven by higher data center sales. Our data center products include a significant amount of software and complexity, which is also helping drive our gross margins. Sequential GAAP operating expenses were up 6%, and non-GAAP operating expenses were up 5%, primarily reflecting increased compensation and benefits. We returned approximately 3.4 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and cash dividends. Our board of directors has just approved an additional 25 billion in stock repurchases to add to our remaining 4 billion of authorization as of the end of Q2. Let me turn to the outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Demand for our data center platform for AI is tremendous and broad-based across industries and customers. Our demand visibility extends into next year. Our supply over the next several quarters will continue to ramp as we lower cycle times and work with our supply partners to add capacity. Additionally, the new L40S GPU will help address the growing demand for many types of workloads from cloud to enterprise. For Q3, total revenue is expected to be 16 billion, plus or minus 2%. We expect sequential growth to be driven largely by data center, with gaming and pro vis also contributing. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 71.5% and 72.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately 2.95 billion and 2 billion, respectively. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be an income of approximately 100 million, excluding gains and losses from nonaffiliated investments. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 14.5%, plus or minus 1%, excluding any discrete items. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website. In closing, let me highlight some upcoming events for the financial community. We will attend the Jefferies Tech Summit on August 30th in Chicago, the Goldman Sachs Tech Conference on September 5th in San Francisco, the Evercore Semiconductor Conference on September 6th, as well as the Citi Tech Conference on September 10th, both in New York, and the BofA Virtual AI Conference on September 11th. Our earnings call to discuss the results of our third quarter of fiscal 2024 is scheduled for Tuesday, November 21st. Operator, we will now open the call for questions. Could you please pull for questions for us? Thank you. Operator Thank you.  We'll take our first question from Matt Ramsay with TD Cowen.

Q2_2024,Matt Ramsay,TD Cowen -- Analyst,"Yes, thank you very much. Good afternoon. Obviously, remarkable results. Jensen, I wanted to ask a question of you regarding the really quickly emerging application of -- of large model inference. So, I think it's pretty well understood by the majority of investors that you guys have a very much a lockdown share of the training market. A lot of the smaller market -- smaller -- smaller model inference workloads have been done on ASICs or CPUs in the past. And with many of these GPT and other really large models, there's this new workload that's accelerating super-duper quickly on -- on large model inference. And I think your -- your Grace Hopper Superchip products and others are pretty well aligned for that. But could you maybe talk to us about how you're seeing the inference market segment between small model inference and large model inference and how your product portfolio is positioned for that? Thanks.",neutral,0.824258268,Neutral,Slightly Positive,0.2,0.5,0.25,0.04,0.01,Neutral
Q2_2024,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah, thanks a lot. So, let's take a quick step back. These large language models are -- are fairly -- are pretty phenomenal. It -- it does several things, of course. It has the ability to understand unstructured language. But at its core, what it has learned is the structure of human language and it has encoded or within it -- compressed within it a large amount of human knowledge that it has learned by the corpuses that it studied. What happens is you create these large language models and you create as large as you can, and then you derive from it smaller versions of the model, essentially teach-your-student models. It's a process called distillation. And -- and so, when you see these smaller -- smaller models, it's very likely the case that they were derived from or distilled from or learned from larger models, and just as you have professors and teachers and students and so on, so forth. And you're going to see this going forward. And so, you start from a very large model and it has to build -- it has a large amount of generality and generalization and -- and what's called zero-shot capability. And so, for a lot of applications and questions or skills that you haven't trained it specifically on, these large language models, miraculously, has the capability to perform them. That's what makes it so magical. On the other hand -- on the other hand, you -- you -- you would like to have these capabilities and all kinds of computing devices. And so, what you do is you distill them down. These smaller models might have excellent capabilities in a particular skill, but they don't generalize as well. They don't have what is called as-good zero-shot capabilities. And so, they all have their own -- own unique capabilities, but -- but you start from very large models. Operator OK, next, we'll go to Vivek Arya with BofA Securities. Your line is now open.",neutral,0.913286448,Neutral,Slightly Positive,0.2,0.5,0.25,0.04,0.01,Slightly Positive
Q2_2024,Vivek Arya,Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst,"Thank you. Just had a quick clarification on a question. Colette, if you could please clarify how much incremental supply do you expect to come online in the next year? You think it's up 20, 30, 40, 50%? So, just any sense of how much supply because you said it's growing every quarter. And then, Jensen, the question for you is, when we look at the overall hyperscaler spending, that pie is not really growing that much. So, what is giving you the confidence that they can continue to carve out more of that pie for generative AI? Just give us your sense of how sustainable is this demand as we look over the next one to two years. So, if I take your implied Q3 outlook of data center, 12 billion,13 billion, what does that say about how many servers are already AI accelerated? Where is that going? So, just give us some confidence that the growth that you are seeing is sustainable into the next one to two years.",neutral,0.799766362,Neutral,Slightly Positive,0.2,0.5,0.25,0.04,0.01,Neutral
Q2_2024,Colette Kress,"Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","So, thanks for that question regarding our supply. Yes, we -- we do expect to continue increasing, ramping our supply over the next quarter, as well as into next fiscal year. In terms of percent, that's not something that we -- we have here. It is a work across so many different suppliers, so many different parts of building, and -- and HGX many of our other new products that are coming to market. But we are very pleased with both the support that we have with our suppliers and the long time that we have spent with them improving their supply.",positive,0.917560101,Strong Positive,Slightly Positive,0.2,0.5,0.25,0.04,0.01,Slightly Positive
Q2_2024,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,"The world has something along the lines of about $1 trillion worth of data centers installed in the cloud and enterprise and otherwise. And that trillion dollars of data centers is in the process of transitioning into accelerated computing and generative AI. We're seeing two simultaneous platform shifts at the same time. One is accelerated computing, and the reason for that is because it's the most cost-effective, most energy-effective, and the most performant way of doing computing now. And so -- so, what you're seeing -- and then, all of a sudden enabled by generative AI -- enabled by accelerated computing, generative AI came along. And this incredible application now gives everyone two reasons to transition, to do a platform shift from general purpose computing, the classical way of doing computing, to this new way of doing computing, accelerated computing. There's about $1 trillion worth of data centers, call it, a quarter of trillion dollars of -- of capital spend each year. You're seeing the -- the data centers around the world are taking that capital spend and focusing it on the two most important trends of -- of computing today, accelerated computing and generative AI. And so, I think this is not a -- this is not a -- a near-term thing. This is a -- a long-term industry transition, and we're seeing these two platform shifts happening at the same time. Operator Next, we go to Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Your line is open.",neutral,0.930615604,Neutral,Slightly Positive,0.2,0.5,0.25,0.04,0.01,Slightly Positive
Q2_2024,Stacy Rasgon,AllianceBernstein -- Analyst,"Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering, Colette, if you could tell me like how much of data center in the quarter, maybe even the guidance, like, systems versus GPU, like DGX versus just the H100. What I'm really trying to get at is how much is like pricing or content, or however you want to define that, versus units actually driving the growth going forward. Can you give us any color around that?",neutral,0.932997465,Neutral,Slightly Positive,0.2,0.5,0.25,0.04,0.01,Neutral
Q2_2024,Colette Kress,"Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Sure, Stacy. Let me help. Within the quarter, our HGX systems were a very significant part of our data center as well as our data center growth that we had seen. Those systems include our HGX of our Hopper architecture but also our Ampere architecture. Yes, we are still selling -- both of these architectures are in the market. Now, when you think about that, what does that mean from both the systems as a unit, of course, is growing quite substantially, and that is driving in terms of the revenue increases. So, both of these things are the drivers of the revenue inside data center. Our DGXs are always a portion of additional systems that we will sell. Those are a great opportunity for our enterprise customers and many other different types of customers that we're seeing even in our consumer internet companies. Now, the importance there is also coming together with software that we sell with our DGXs, but that's a portion of our sales that we're doing. The rest of the GPUs, we have new GPUs coming to market that we talk about, the L40S, and they will add continued growth going forward. But again, the largest driver of our revenue within this last quarter was definitely the HGX system.",neutral,0.728232145,Neutral,Slightly Positive,0.2,0.5,0.25,0.04,0.01,Slightly Positive
Q2_2024,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,"And, Stacy, if I could just add something. The -- you -- you say it's H100, and I know you know what your -- your -- your mental image in your mind, but the H100 is 35,000 parts, 70 pounds, nearly a trillion transistors in combination; takes a robot to build -- well, many robots to build because it's 70 pounds to lift. And it takes a supercomputer to test a supercomputer. And so, these -- these things are technology marvels, and -- and the manufacturing of them is really intensive. And so -- so I think we -- you know, we call it H100 as if it's a chip that comes off of a fab, but H100s go -- go out really as HGX as they are the world's hyperscalers, and -- and they're really really quite large system components, if you will.

Q2_2024,Mark Lipacis,Jefferies -- Analyst,"Hi, thanks for taking my question, and congrats on the -- on the success. Jensen, it seems like the -- a key part of the success -- your success in the market is delivering the software ecosystem along with the chip and the hardware platform. And I had a two-part question on this. I was wondering if you could just help us understand the evolution of your software ecosystem, the critical elements. And is there a way to quantify your lead on this dimension, like how many person years you've invested in building it? And then, part two, I was wondering if you would care to share with us your view on what percentage of the value of the Nvidia platform is hardware differentiation versus software differentiation. Thank you.",neutral,0.856428027,Neutral,Slightly Positive,0.2,0.5,0.25,0.04,0.01,Neutral
Q2_2024,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah, Mark, thanks for your question. The -- let me see if I could use some metrics. So, we have a runtime score in the AI enterprise. This is -- this is one part of our software stack. And this is -- this is, if you will, the runtime that just about every company uses for the end-to-end of machine learning, from data processing, the training of any model that you -- that you like to do on any framework you like to do, the inference, and the deployment, the scaling it out into data center, could be a scale-out for a hyperscale data center, could be a scale-out for enterprise data center, for example, on VMware. You can do this on any of our GPUs. We have hundreds of millions of GPUs in the field and millions of GPUs in the cloud in just about every single cloud. And it runs in a single GPU configuration as well as multi-GPU per compute or multi-node. It also has multiple -- multiple sessions or multiple -- multiple computing instances per GPU. So, from multiple instances per GPU to multiple GPUs, multiple nodes, to entire data center scale. So, this runtime called NVIDIA AI Enterprise has something like 4,500 software packages, software libraries and has something like 10,000 dependencies among each other. And that runtime is -- is, as I mentioned, continuously updated and optimized for -- for our install base for our stack. And that's just one example of what it would take to get accelerated computing to work that the number of -- of code combinations and type of application combinations is really quite insane. And that's taken us two decades to get here. But what I would -- what I would -- what I would characterize as probably our -- are the elements of our -- of our -- of our company, if you will, are several. I would say number one is architecture. The flexibility, the versatility, and the performance of our architecture makes it possible for us to do all the things that I just said, you know, from data processing to training, to inference, for preprocessing of the data before you do the inference, to the post-processing of the data, tokenizing of -- of -- of -- of languages so that you could then train -- train with it. The amount of the workflow is much more intense than just training or inference. But anyways, that's where we'll focus, and is fine. But -- but when people actually use these computing systems, it's quite -- requires a lot of applications. And so, the combination of our architecture makes it possible for us to deliver the lowest cost of ownership. And the reason for that is because -- because we accelerate so many different things. The second characteristic of our -- of our company is the install base. You know, you have to ask yourself why is it that all the software developers come to our platform. And the reason for that is because software developers seek a large install base so that they can reach the largest number of end users so that they could build a business or get a return on the investments that they make. And -- and then, the third characteristic is reach. We're in the cloud today, both for public cloud -- public-facing cloud because we have so many customers that use -- so many developers and customers, they use our -- our platform. CSPs are delighted to put it up in the cloud. They use it for internal consumption, you know, to develop and train and operate recommender systems or search or data processing engines and whatnot, all the way to training and inference. And so, we're in the cloud, we're in enterprise. Yesterday, we had a very big announcement. It's really worthwhile to -- to take a look at that. VMware is the operating system of the world's enterprise. And we've been working together for several years now and we're going to bring together -- together, we're going to bring generative AI to the world's enterprises all the way out to the edge. And so, reach is another reason. And because of reach, all of the world's system makers are anxious to put Nvidia's platform in their systems. And so, we have a very broad distribution from all of the world's OEMs and ODMs and so on and so forth because of our reach. And then, lastly, because of our scale and velocity, we were -- we were able to sustain this -- this really complex stack of software and hardware and networking and compute and across all of these different usage models and different computing environments. And we're able to -- to do all this while accelerating the velocity of our engineering. You know, it seems like we're introducing a new architecture every two years now. We're introducing a new architecture, a new new product just about every six months. And so, these -- these properties make it possible for the ecosystem to build their company and their business on top of us. And so, those in combination makes it special.

Q2_2024,Atif Malik,Citi -- Analyst,"Hi, thank you for taking my question. And great job on the results and outlook. Colette, I have a question on the cool-off list, L40S that you guys talked about. Any idea how much of the supply tightness can L40S help with? And if you can talk about the incremental profitability or gross margin contribution from this product. Thank you.",neutral,0.789344788,Neutral,Slightly Positive,0.2,0.5,0.25,0.04,0.01,Neutral
Q2_2024,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah, Atif, let me -- let me take that for -- for you. The L40 -- L40S is really designed for a different type of application. H100 is designed for large-scale language models and processing, just very large models and a great deal of data. And so, that's -- that's not L40S' focus. L40S' focus is to be able to fine-tune models -- fine-tune pre-trained models and it'll do that incredibly well. It has a transformer engine. It's got a lot of performance. You can get multiple GPUs in a -- in a server. It's designed for -- for hyperscale scale-out, meaning it's easy to -- to -- to install L40S servers into the world's hyperscale data centers. It comes in a standard rack, standard server. And everything about it is standard, and so it's easy to install. L40S also is, with the software stack around it and along with BlueField-3, and all the work that we did with VMware and the work that we did with Snow -- Snowflake's and -- and ServiceNow and so many other enterprise partners, L40S is designed for the world's enterprise IT systems. And that's the reason why HPE, Dell, and Lenovo, and some 20 other system makers building about 100 different configurations of enterprise servers are going to work with us to take generative AI to the world's enterprise. And so, L40S is really designed for -- for a different -- different type of scale-out, if you will. It's, of course, large language models. It's, of course, generative AI, but it's a different use case. And the L40S is going to -- is off to a great start, and, you know, the world's enterprise and hyperscalers are really clamoring to get -- get L40S deployed.

Q2_2024,Joe Moore,Morgan Stanley -- Analyst,"Great. Thank you. I guess the thing about these numbers that's so remarkable to me is the amount of demand that remains unfulfilled. Talking to some of your customers, you know, as good as these numbers are, you sort of more than tripled your revenue in a couple of quarters. There's -- there's a demand, in some cases, for -- for multiples of what people are getting. So, can you talk about that, how much-unfulfilled demand do you think there is?

Q2_2024,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah, we have excellent visibility through the year and into next year. And we're already planning the next-generation infrastructure with the leading CSPs and data center builders. The demand -- the easiest way to think about the demand is the world is transitioning from general-purpose computing to accelerated computing. That's the easiest way to think about the demand. The best way for companies to increase their throughput, improve their energy efficiency, improve their cost efficiency, is to divert their capital budget to accelerated computing and generative AI. Because by doing that, you're going to offload so much workload off of the CPUs that the available CPUs is -- in your data center will get boosted. And -- and so, what you're seeing companies do now is recognizing this -- this, the tipping point here, recognizing the beginning of this transition, and diverting their capital investment to accelerated computing and generative AI. And so -- so, that's -- that's probably the easiest way to think about the opportunity ahead of us. This isn't a -- a singular application that -- that is driving the demand, but this is a new computing platform, if you will, a new computing transition that's happening, and data centers all over the world are responding to this and shifting, you know, in a broad-based way.

Colette, I think, last quarter, you had said CSPs were about 40% of your data center revenue; consumer internet, 30%; enterprise, 30%. Based on your remarks, it sounded like CSPs and consumer internet may have been a larger percentage of your business. If you can kind of clarify that or confirm that, that would be super helpful. And then, Jensen, a question for you. You know, given your position as the key enabler of AI, the breadth of engagements and the visibility you have into customer projects, I'm curious how confident you are that there will be enough applications or use cases for your customers to generate a reasonable return on their investments. I guess I asked the question because there is a concern out there that, you know, there could be a bit of a pause in your -- in your demand profile in the outyears.

Our CSPs -- our large CSPs are contributing a little bit more than 50% of our revenue within Q2, and the next largest category will be our consumer internet companies. And then, the last piece of it will be our enterprise and high-performance computing.",neutral,0.861459732,Neutral,Slightly Positive,0.2,0.5,0.25,0.04,0.01,Slightly Positive
Q2_2024,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Toshi, I'm reluctant to -- to guess about the future, and so I'll answer the question from the first principle of computer science perspective. It is -- it is recognized, for some time now, that general-purpose computing is just not in-brute forcing general-purpose computing. Using general-purpose computing at scale is no longer the best way to go forward. It's too costly, it's too expensive, and the performance of the applications are too slow, right? And finally, the world has a new way of doing it. It's called accelerated computing. And what kicked it into turbocharge is generative AI. But accelerated computing could be used for all kinds of different applications that's already in the data center. And by using it, you offload the CPUs, you save a ton of money, an order of magnitude in cost and order of magnitude in energy, and the throughput is higher. And -- and that's what -- that's what the industry is really responding to. Going forward, the best way to invest in a data center is to divert the capital investment from general-purpose computing and focus it on generative AI and accelerated computing. Generative AI provides a new way of generating productivity, a new way of generating new services to offer to your customers, and accelerated computing helps you save money and save power. And -- and the number of applications is -- is, well, you know, tons, lots of developers, lots of applications, lots of libraries. It's ready to be deployed. And so, I think -- I think the data centers around the world recognize that this is the -- the best way to deploy resources, deploy capital going forward for data centers. This is true for the world's clouds, and -- and -- and you're seeing a whole crop of -- of new GPUs -- specialty GPU-specialized cloud service providers. One of the famous ones is CoreWeave, and they're doing incredibly well. But you're seeing the regional GPU specialists -- service providers all over the world now, and -- and -- and because they all recognize the same thing, that the best way to invest your capital going forward is to put it into accelerated computing and generative AI. We're also seeing that -- that enterprises want to do that. But in order for enterprises to do it, you have to support the management system, the operating system, the security, and software -- software-defined data center approach of enterprises, and that's called VMware. And we've been working several years with VMware to make it possible for VMware to support, not just the virtualization of CPUs, but the virtualization of GPUs as well as the distributed computing capabilities of GPUs, supporting NVIDIA's BlueField for high-performance networking. And all of the generative AI libraries that we've been working on is now going to be offered as a special SKU by VMware's sales force, which is, as we all know, quite large because they reach some several hundred thousand VMware customers around the world. And this new SKU is going to be called VMware Private AI Foundation. And -- and this will be a new SKU that makes it possible for enterprises. And in combination with HPE, Dell, and Lenovo's new server offerings based on L40S, any -- any enterprise could have a state-of-the-art AI data center and be able to engage generative AI. And so, I think the -- the -- the answer to -- to that question, it's hard to predict exactly what's going to happen quarter to quarter. But I think the trend is very very clear now that we're seeing a platform shift. Operator Next, we'll go to Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Your line is now open.",neutral,0.914351404,Neutral,Slightly Positive,0.2,0.5,0.25,0.04,0.01,Neutral
Q2_2024,Tim Arcuri,UBS -- Analyst,"Thanks a lot. Can you talk about the attach rate of your networking solutions to your -- to -- to the compute that you're shipping? In other words, is -- is like half of your compute shipping with your networking solutions, you know, more than half, less than half, and is this something that maybe you can use to prioritize allocation of the -- of -- of the GPUs? Thank you.",neutral,0.917927504,Neutral,Slightly Positive,0.2,0.5,0.25,0.04,0.01,Neutral
Q2_2024,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Well, working backwards, we don't use that to prioritize the allocation of our GPUs. We let customers decide what networking they would like to use. And for the customers that are building very large infrastructure, InfiniBand is, you know, I hate to say it, kind of a no-brainer. And the reason for that, because -- because the efficiency of InfiniBand is so significant. You know, some 10, 15, 20% higher throughput for $1 billion infrastructure translates to enormous savings. Basically, the networking is free. And so, if you have a -- a single application, if you will, infrastructure or it's largely dedicated to large language models or large AI systems, InfiniBand is really -- really a terrific choice. However, if you're -- if you're hosting for a lot of different users and -- and Ethernet is really important to the way you manage your data center, we have -- we have an excellent solution there that we just recently announced and it's called Spectrum X, where we're going to bring the capabilities, if you will, not all of it, but -- but some of it of the capabilities of InfiniBand, to Ethernet so that we can -- we can also, within the -- the environment of Ethernet, allow you to -- enable you to get excellent generative AI capabilities. So, Spectrum X is -- is just ramping now. It requires BlueField-3 and supports both our Spectrum-2 and Spectrum-3 Ethernet switches. And the additional performance is really spectacular. And, you know, BlueField-3 makes it possible and a whole bunch of software that goes along with it. BlueField -- BlueField, as all of you know, is -- is a project really dear to my heart. And it's -- it's off to just a tremendous start. I think it's a home run. This is the -- the concept of -- of in-network computing, and putting a lot of software in the computing fabric is being realized with -- with BlueField-3. And it is going to be a home run.

Can you talk about the reception that you're seeing and, you know, how the momentum is going? And then, Colette, can you also talk about your software business? What is the run rate right now and the materiality of that business? And it does seem like it's already helping margins a bit. Thank you very much.",neutral,0.739759266,Neutral,Neutral,0.1,0.2,0.5,0.1,0.1,Neutral
Q2_2024,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,"DGX Cloud's strategy, let me start there. DGX Cloud's strategy is to -- to achieve several things: number one, to enable a really close partnership between us and the world's CSPs. We -- we recognize that -- that many of our -- we work with some 30,000 companies around the world, 15,000 of them are start-ups, thousands of them are generative AI companies. And the fastest-growing segment, of course, is generative AI. We're working with all of -- all of the world's AI start-ups. And -- and -- and ultimately, they would like to be able to land in one of the world's leading clouds. And -- and so, we -- we built DGX Cloud as a footprint inside the world's leading clouds so that we could simultaneously work with all of our AI partners and help land them in -- easily in one of our cloud partners. The second benefit is that it allows our CSPs and ourselves to work really closely together to improve the performance of hyperscale clouds, which is historically designed for multi-tenancy and not designed for high-performance distributed computing like generative AI. And so, to be able to work closely architecturally to -- to have our engineers work hand in hand to improve the networking performance and the computing performance has been really powerful, really terrific. And then, thirdly, of course, Nvidia uses very large infrastructures ourselves, and -- and our self-driving car team, our Nvidia research team, our generative AI team, our language model team. You know, the amount of infrastructure that we need is quite -- quite significant. And none of our -- none of our optimizing compilers are possible without our DGX systems. Even compilers these days require AI, and optimizing software and infrastructure software requires AI to -- to even develop. It's been well publicized that our engineering uses AI to design our chips. And so -- so, the internal -- our own consumption of AI, robotics team, so and so forth; Omniverse team, so on and so forth, all needs AI, and so -- all right? So, our -- our internal consumption is quite large as well, and we land that in DGX Cloud. And so, DFX Cloud has multiple -- multiple use cases, multiple drivers, and it's been off to an -- just an enormous success. Our -- our -- our CSPs love it. The developers love it. And our own internal engineers are clamoring to have more of it. And it's a great way for us to engage and work closely with all of the AI ecosystem around the world.",neutral,0.840868175,Neutral,Slightly Positive,0.2,0.4,0.3,0.1,0,Strong Positive
Q2_2024,Colette Kress,"Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","And let's see if I can answer your question regarding our software revenue and part of our opening remarks that we made as well. Remember, software is a part of almost all of our products, whether they are data center products, GPUs, systems, or any of our products within gaming and our future automotive products. You're correct, we're also selling it in a stand-alone business. And that stand-alone software continues to grow, where we are providing both the software, services, upgrades across there as well. Now, we're seeing, at this point, probably hundreds of millions of dollars annually for our software business. And we are looking at NVIDIA AI Enterprise to be included with many of the products that we're selling, such as our DGX, such as our PCIe versions of our H100. And I think we're going to see more availability even with our CSP marketplaces. So, we're off to a great start, and I do believe we'll see this continue to grow going forward. Operator And that does include today's question-and-answer session.

Q2_2024,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,"A new computing era has begun. The industry is simultaneously going through two platform transitions: accelerated computing and generative AI. Data centers are making a platform shift from general-purpose to accelerated computing. The trillion dollars of global data centers will transition to accelerated computing to achieve an order of magnitude better performance, energy efficiency, and cost. Accelerated computing enabled generative AI, which is now driving a platform shift in software and enabling new, never-before-possible applications. Together, accelerated computing and generative AI are driving a broad-based computer industry platform shift. Our demand is tremendous. We are significantly expanding our production capacity. Supply will substantially increase for the rest of this year and next year. Nobody has been preparing for this for over two decades and has created a new computing platform that the world's industry -- world's industries can build upon. What makes them so special are, one, architecture. Nvidia accelerates everything from data processing, training inference every AI model, real-time speech-to-computer vision, and giant recommenders to vector databases. The performance and versatility of our architecture translates to the lowest data center TCO, and best energy efficiency. Two, install base. Nvidia has hundreds of millions of CUDA-compatible GPUs worldwide. Developers need a large install base to reach end users and grow their business. Nvidia is the developer's preferred platform. More developers create more applications that make Nvidia more valuable for customers. Three, reach. Nvidia's in cloud's enterprise data centers, industrial edge, PCs, workstations, instruments, and robotics. Each has fundamentally unique computing models and ecosystems. System suppliers like OEMs -- computer OEMs can confidently invest in Nvidia because we offer significant market demand and reach. Scale and velocity. Nvidia has achieved significant -- significant scale and is 100% invested in accelerated computing and generative AI. Our ecosystem partners can trust that we have the expertise, focus, and scale to deliver a strong roadmap and reach to help them grow. We are accelerating because of the additive results of these capabilities. We're upgrading and adding new products about every six months versus every two years to address the expanding universe of generative AI. While we increase the output of H100 for training and inference of large language models, we're ramping up our new L40S universal GPU for scale -- for cloud scale-out and enterprise servers. Spectrum X, which consists of our Ethernet switch, BlueField-3, supernet, and software helps customers who want the best possible AI performance on Ethernet infrastructures. Customers are already working on next-generation, accelerated computing and generative AI with our Grace Hopper. We're extending NVIDIA AI to the world's enterprises that demand generative AI but with the model privacy, security, and sovereignty. Together with the world's leading enterprise IT companies, Accenture, Adobe, Getty, Hugging Face, Snowflake, ServiceNow, VMware, and WPP; and our enterprise system partners, Dell, HPE, and Lenovo, we are bringing generative AI to the world's enterprise. We're building NVIDIA Omniverse to digitalize and enable the world's multi-trillion-dollar heavy industries to use generative AI to automate how they build and operate physical assets and achieve greater productivity. Generative AI starts in the cloud, but the most significant opportunities are in the world's largest industries where companies can realize trillions of dollars of productivity gains. It is an exciting time for Nvidia, our customers, partners, and the entire ecosystem to drive this generational shift in computing. We look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter.

Q3_2024,Colette Kress,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"Thanks, Simona. Q3 was another record quarter. Revenue of $18.1 million was up 34% sequentially and up more than 200% year on year and well above our outlook of $16 billion. Starting with data center, the continued ramp of the NVIDIA HGX platform based on our Hopper Tensor Core GPU architecture, along with InfiniBand end-to-end networking drove record revenue of $14.5 billion, up 41% sequentially and up 279% year on year. NVIDIA HDX with InfiniBand together are essentially the reference architecture for AI supercomputers and data center infrastructures. Some of the most exciting generative AI applications are built and run on NVIDIA, including Adobe, Firefly, ChatGPT, Microsoft 365 Copilot, CoAssist, Now Assist with ServiceNow, and Zoom AI Companion. Our data center compute revenue quadrupled from last year and networking revenue nearly tripled. Investment in infrastructure for training and inferencing large language models, deep learning recommender systems, and generative AI applications is fueling strong broad-based demand for NVIDIA accelerated computing. Inferencing is now a major workload for NVIDIA AI computing. Consumer Internet companies and enterprises drove exceptional sequential growth in Q3, comprising approximately half of our data center revenue and outpacing total growth. Companies like Meta are in full production with learning recommender systems and also investing in center to AI to help advertisers optimize images and text. Most major consumer Internet companies are racing to ramp up generative AI deployment. The enterprise wave of AI adoption is now beginning. Enterprise software companies such as Adobe, Databricks, Snowflake, and ServiceNow are adding AI copilots and assistants with their pipelines. And broader enterprises are developing custom AI for vertical industry applications such as Tesla and autonomous driving. Cloud service providers drove roughly the other half of our data center revenue in the quarter. Demand was strong from all hyperscale CSPs as well as from a broadening set of GPU-specialized CSPs globally that are rapidly growing to address the new market opportunities in AI. NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPU instances are now generally available in virtually every cloud with instances and high demand. We have significantly increased supply every quarter this year to meet strong demand and expect to continue to do so next year. We will also have a broader and faster product launch cadence to meet a growing and diverse set of AI opportunities. Toward the end of the quarter, the U.S. government announced a new set of export control regulations for China and other markets, including Vietnam and certain countries in the Middle East. These regulations require licenses for the export of a number of our products, including our Hopper and MPIR 100 and 800 series and several others. Our sales to China and other affected destinations derived from products that are now subject to licensing requirements have consistently contributed approximately 20% to 25% of data center revenue over the past few quarters. We expect that our sales to these destinations will decline significantly in the fourth quarter, though we believe will be more than offset by strong growth in other regions. The U.S. government designed the regulation to allow the U.S. industry to provide data center compute products to markets worldwide, including China. Continuing to compete worldwide as the regulations encourage, promote U.S. technology leadership, spurs economic growth, and support U.S. jobs. For the highest performance levels, the government requires licenses. For lower performance levels, the government requires a streamlined prior notification process. And for products, even lower performance levels, the government does not require any notice at all. Following the government's clear guidelines, we are working to expand our data center product portfolio to offer compliant solutions for each regulatory category, including products for which the U.S. government does not wish to have advanced notice before each shipment. We are working with some customers in China and the Middle East to pursue licenses from the U.S. government. It is too early to know whether these will be granted for any significant amount of revenue. Many countries are awakening to the need to invest in sovereign AI infrastructure to support economic growth and industrial innovation. With investments in domestic compute capacity, nations can use their own data to train LLMs and support their local generative AI ecosystem. For example, we are working with India Government and largest tech companies, including Infosys, Reliance, and Tata, to boost their sovereign AI infrastructure. And French private cloud provider, Scaleway, is building a regional AI cloud based on NVIDIA H100, InfiniBand, and NVIDIA AI enterprise software to fuel advancement across France and Europe. National investment in compute capacity is a new economic imperative and serving the sovereign AI infrastructure market represents a multibillion-dollar opportunity over the next few years. From a product perspective, the vast majority of revenue in Q3 was driven by the NVIDIA HGX platform based on our Hopper GPU architecture with lower contribution from the prior generation Ampere GPU architecture. The new L40s GPU built for industry-standard servers began to ship supporting training and inference workloads across a variety of customers. This was also the first revenue quarter of our GH 200 Grace Hopper Secret chip, which combines our ARM-based Grace GPU with a Hopper GPU. Grace and Grace Hopper are ramping into a new multibillion-dollar product line. Grace Hopper instances are now available at GPU-specialized cloud providers and coming soon to Oracle Cloud. Grace Hopper is also getting significant traction with supercomputing customers, initial system shipments to LaSalle, Localimos, National Lab, and the Swiss National Supercomputing Center took place in the third quarter. The U.K. government announced it will build one of the world's fastest AI supercomputer called Isambard-AI with almost 5,500 Grace Hopper Super chips. German Supercomputing Center, Elec, also announced that it will build its next-generation AI supercomputer with close to 24,000 Grace Hopper super chips and Quantum 2 InfiniBand, making it the world's most powerful AI supercomputer with over 90 exaflops of AI performance. All in, we estimate that the combined AI compute capacity of all the supercomputers built on Grace Hopper across the U.S., Europe, and Japan next year will exceed 200 exaflops with more wins to come. It is contributing significantly to our data center demand as AI is now in full production for deep learning, recommends, serve chatbots, copilots, and text image generation. And this is just the beginning. NVIDIA AI offers the best inference performance and versatility, and thus, the lower power and cost of ownership. We are also driving a fast cost-reduction curve. With the release of NVIDIA TensorRT LLM, we now achieved more than 2x the inference performance or half the cost of inferencing LLM by NVIDIA GPUs. We also announced the latest member of the Hopper family, BH 200, which will be the first GPU to offer HBM3E, faster, larger memory to further accelerate generative AI and LLMs. It boosts inference being up to 2x compared to H100 GPUs for running LLM like Lambda2. Combined, TensorRT LLM and H200 increased performance or reduced cost by 4x in just one year with our customers changing their stock. This is a benefit of CUDA and our architecture compatibility. Compared to the H100, H200 delivers an 18x performance increase for inferencing models like GPT-3, allowing customers to move to larger models and with no increase in latency. Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and Oracle Cloud will be among the first CSPs to offer H200 base instances starting next year. At last week's Microsoft Ignite, we deepened and expanded our collaboration with Microsoft across higher stock. We introduced an AI foundry service for the development and tuning of custom generative AI enterprise applications running on Azure. Customers can bring their domain knowledge and proprietary data and we help them build their AI models using our AI expertise and software stack in our DGX Cloud, all with enterprise-grade security and support. SAP and Amdocs are the first customers of the NVIDIA AI foundry service on Microsoft Azure. In addition, Microsoft will launch new confidential computing instances based on the H100. The H100 remains the top-performing and most versatile platform for AI training and by a wide margin, as shown in the latest MLPerf industry benchmark results. Our training cluster included more than 10,000 H-100 GPUs or 3x more than in June, reflecting very efficient scaling. Efficient scaling is a key requirement in generative AI because LLM are growing by an order of magnitude every year. Microsoft Azure achieved similar results on the nearly identical cluster, demonstrating the efficiency of NVIDIA AI and public cloud deployments. Networking now exceeds a $10 billion annualized revenue run rate. Strong growth was driven by exceptional demand for InfiniBand, which grew fivefold year on year. InfiniBand is critical to gain the scale and performance needed for training LLMs. Microsoft made this very point last week highlighting that Azure uses over 29,000 miles of InfiniBand cabling, enough to circle the globe. We are expanding NVIDIA networking into the Ethernet space. Our new Spectrum end-to-end Ethernet offering with technologies purpose-built for AI will be available in Q1 next year with support from leading OEMs, including Dell, HP, and Lenovo. Spectrum X can achieve 1.6x higher networking performance for AI communication compared to traditional ethernet offerings. Let me also provide an update on our software and services offerings, where we are starting to see excellent options. We are on track to exit the year at an annualized revenue run rate of $1 billion for recurring software, support, and services offerings. We see two primary opportunities for growth over the intermediate term with our DGX Cloud service and with our NVIDIA AI enterprise software. Each reflects the growth of enterprise AI training and enterprise AI inference, respectively. Our latest DGX Cloud customer announcement was this morning as part of an AI research collaboration with Gentech, the biotechnology Pioneer also plans to use our Bionemo-LLM framework to help accelerate and optimize their AI drug discovery platform. We now have enterprise AI partnerships with Adobe, Dropbox, Getty, SAP, ServiceNow, Snowflake, and others to come. OK. Moving to gaming. Gaming revenue of $2.86 billion was up 15% sequentially and up more than 80% year on year, with strong demand in the important back-to-school shopping season, with NVIDIA RTX retracing and AI technologies now available at price points as low as $299. We enter the holidays with the best-ever lineup for gamers and creators. Gaming has doubled relative to pre-COVID levels, even against the backdrop of lackluster PC market performance. This reflects the significant value we've brought to the gaming ecosystem with innovations like RTX and BLSS. The number of games and applications supporting these technologies has exploded in that period, driving upgrade, and attracting your buyers. The RTX ecosystem continues to grow. There are now over 475 RTX-enabled games and applications. Generative AI is quickly emerging as the new pillar app for high-performance PCs, NVIDIA RTX GPUs to find the most performance AI PCs and workstations. We just released TensorRT LLM for Windows, which speeds provides LLM inference up by 4x. With an installed base of over 100 million, NVIDIA RTX is the natural platform for AI application developers. Finally, our GeForce NOW cloud gaming service continues to build momentum. Its library of PC games surpassed 1,700 titles, including the launches of Alan Wake 2, Baldur's Gate 3, Cyberpunk 2077, Fantom Liberty, and Starfield. Moving to ProViz. Revenue of $416 million was up 10% sequentially and up 108% year on year. NVIDIA RTX is the workstation platform of choice for professional design, engineering, and simulation use cases and AI is emerging as a powerful demand driver. Early applications include inference for AI imaging in healthcare and edge AI in smart spaces and the public sector. We launched a new line of desktop workstations based on NVIDIA RTX Ada Lovelace generation GPUs and ConnectX, Smart NIC, offering up to 2x the AI processing, ray tracing, and graphics performance of the previous generation. These powerful new workstations are optimized for AI workloads such as fine-tuned AI models, training smaller models, and running inference locally. We continue to make progress on Omniverse, our software platform for designing, building, and operating 3D virtual world. Mercedes-Benz is using Omniverse power digital trends to plan, design, build, and operate its manufacturing and assembly facilities, helping it to increase efficiency and reduce defects. Oxford is also incorporating Omniverse into its manufacturing process, including end-to-end simulation for the entire robotics and automation pipeline, saving time and cost. We announced two new Omniverse cloud services for automotive, digitalization available on Microsoft Azure, a virtual factory simulation engine, and autonomous vehicle simulation engine. Moving to automotive. Revenue was $261 million, up 3% sequentially and up 4% year on year, primarily driven by continued growth in self-driving platforms based on NVIDIA drive or an SoC and the ramp of AI cockpit solutions with global OEM customers. We extended our automotive partnership with Foxconn to include NVIDIA Drive 4, our next-generation automotive SoCs. Foxconn has become the ODM for EVs. Our partnership provides Foxconn with a standard AV sensor and computing platform for their customers to easily build a state-of-an-art safe and secure software-defined car. Now we're going to move to the rest of the P&L. GAAP gross margin expanded to 74% and non-GAAP gross margin to 75%, driven by higher data center sales and lower net inventory reserves, including a one percentage point benefit from the release of previously reserved inventory related to the Ampere GPU architecture products. Sequentially, GAAP operating expenses were up 12% and non-GAAP operating expenses were up 10%, primarily reflecting increased compensation benefits. Let me turn to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. Total revenue is expected to be $20 billion, plus or minus 2%. We strong sequential growth to be driven by data center with continued strong demand for both compute and networking. Gaming will likely decline sequentially of now as it is now more aligned with notebook seasonality. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 74.5% and 75.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $3.17 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively. GAAP and non-GAAP Other income and expenses are expected to be an income of approximately $200 million, excluding gains and losses from nonaffiliated investments. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 15% plus or minus 1%, excluding any discrete items. Further financial information are included in the different commentary and other information available on our IR website. In closing, let me highlight some upcoming events for the financial community. We will attend the UBS Global Technology Conference in Scottsdale, Arizona on November 28 and the Wells Fargo TMT Summit in Rancho Palos Verdes, California on November 29; the Arena Virtual Tech Conference on December 7; and the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco on January 8. Our earnings call to discuss the results of our fourth quarter and fiscal 2024 is scheduled for Wednesday, February 21. We will now open the call for questions.

Q3_2024,Colette Kress,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,"So, first, let me start with your question, Vivek, on export controls and the impact that we are seeing in our Q4 outlook and guidance that we provided. We had seen historically over the last several quarters that China and some of the other impacted destinations to be about 20% to 25% of our data center revenue. We are expecting in our guidance for that to decrease substantially as we move into Q4. The export controls will have a negative effect on our China business, and we do not have good visibility into the magnitude of that impact even over the long term. We are, though, working to expand our data center product portfolio to possibly offer new regulation compliance solutions that do not require a license. These products, they may become available in the next coming months. However, we don't expect their contribution to be material or meaningful as a percentage of the revenue in Q4.",negative,0.470436752,Slightly Negative,Slightly Negative,0,0.1,0.4,0.4,0.1,Slightly Negative
Q3_2024,Jen-Hsun Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Generative AI is the largest TAM expansion of software and hardware that we've seen in several decades. At the core of it, what's really exciting is that what was largely a retrieval-based computing approach, almost everything that you do as we treated off of storage somewhere. As has been augmented now add it with a generative method, and it's changed almost everything. You could see that text to text, text to image, text to video, text to 3D, text to protein, text to chemicals. These are things that were processed and typed by humans in the past, and these are now generative approaches. The way that we access data has changed. It used to be based on explicit queries, it is now based on natural language queries, intention queries, semantic queries. And so, we're excited about the work that we're doing with SAP and Dropbox and many others that you're going to hear about. And one of the areas that is really impactful is the software industry, which is about $1 trillion or so has been building tools that are manually used over the last couple of decades. And now, there's a whole new segment of software called copilots and assistants, instead of manually use these tools will have copilots to help you use it. And so, instead of licensing software, we will continue to do that, of course, but we will also hire copilots and assistants to help us use the -- use the software. We'll connect all of these copilots and systems into teams of AI, which is going to be the modern version of software, modern version of enterprise business software. And so, the transformation of software and the way that software is done is driving the hardware underneath. And you can see that it's transforming in two ways. One is something that's largely independent of generative AI. There's two trends. One is related to accelerated computing. General-purpose computing is too wasteful of energy and cost. And now that we have a much, much better approaches called accelerated computing, you could save an order of magnitude of energy, you could save an order of magnitude of time where you can save an order of magnitude of cost by using acceleration. And so, accelerated computing is transitioning, if you will, general-purpose computing into this new approach. And that has been augmented by a new class of data centers. This is the traditional data centers that you were just talking about, where we represent about a third of that. But there's a new class of data centers. And this new class of data centers, unlike the data centers of the past where you have a lot of applications running used by a great many people that are different tenants that are using the same infrastructure, and the data center stores a lot of files. These new data essentials are very few applications if not one application used by basically one tenant. And it processes data. It trains models and it generates tokens, it generates AI. And we call these new data center AI factories. We're seeing AI factories being built out everywhere in just about every country. And so, if you look at the way where we are in the expansion, the transition into this new computing approach, the first wave you saw with large language model start-ups, generative AI start-ups, and consumer Internet companies. And we're in the process of ramping that. Meanwhile, that's being ramped. You see that we're starting to partner with enterprise software companies who would like to build chatbots and copilots and assistants to augment the tools that they have on their platforms. You're seeing GPU-specialized CSPs cropping up all over the world, and they're dedicated to doing really one thing, which is processing AI. You're seeing sovereign AI infrastructures, people, countries that now recognize that they have to utilize their own data, keep their own data, keep their own culture, process that data, and develop their own AI. You see that in India. Several -- about a year ago in Sweden, you're seeing in Japan. Last week, a big announcement in France. But the number of sovereign AI clouds that are being built is really quite significant. And my guess is that almost every major region will have, and surely, every major country will have their own AI cloud. And so, I think you're seeing just new developments as the generative AI wave propagates through every industry, every company, every region. And so, we're at the beginning of this inflection, this computing transition. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers of Wells Fargo.

Q3_2024,Aaron Rakers,Well Fargo Securities -- Analyst,Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about kind of the networking side of the business. Given the growth rates that you've now cited. I think it's 155% year over year and strong growth sequentially. It looks like that business is like almost approaching a $2.5 billion to $3 billion quarterly level. I'm curious of how you see Ethernet involved -- evolving and maybe how you would characterize your differentiation of Spectrum X relative to the traditional Ethernet stack as we start to think about that becoming part of the networking narrative above and maybe beyond just InfiniBand as we look into next year? Thank you.,neutral,0.873044133,Neutral,Neutral,0.1,0.2,0.5,0.1,0.1,Slightly Positive
Q3_2024,Jen-Hsun Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah. Thanks for the question. Our networking business is already at a $10 billion-plus run rate. And it's going to get much larger. And as you mentioned, we added a new networking platform to our networking business recently. The vast majority of the dedicated large-scale AI factories standardized on InfiniBand. And the reason for that is really because of its data rate and not only just the latency but the way that it moves traffic around the network is really important. The way that you process AI and a multi-tenant hyperscale Ethernet environment, the traffic pattern is just radically different. And with InfiniBand and with software-defined networks, we could do congestion control, adaptive routing, performance isolation, and noise isolation, not to mention, of course, the data rate and the low latency that -- and the very low overhead of InfiniBand that's a natural part of InfiniBand. And so, InfiniBand is not so much just a network. It's also a computing fabric. We put a lot of software-defined capabilities into the fabric, including computation. We do floating point calculations and computation right on the switch and right in the fabric itself. And so, that's the reason why that difference in Ethernet versus InfiniBand where InfiniBand versus Ethernet for AI factories is so dramatic. And the difference is profound and the reason for that is because you've just invested in a $2 billion infrastructure for AI factories, a 20%, 25%, 30% difference in overall effectiveness, especially as you scale up is measured in hundreds of millions of dollars of value. And if you were renting that infrastructure over the course of four or five years, it really adds up. And so, InfiniBand's value proposition is undeniable for AI factories. However, as we move AI into enterprise, this is enterprise computing where we'd like to enable every company to be able to build their own custom AI. We're building customer AIs in our company based on our proprietary data, our proprietary type of skills. For example, recently, we spoke about one of the models that we're creating. It's called Chip Nemo. We're building many others. There'll be tens, hundreds of custom AI models that we create inside our company. And our company is -- for all of our employees, doesn't have to be as high performance as the AI factories, we use to train the models. And so, we would like the AI to be able to run an Ethernet environment. And so, what we've done is we invented this new platform that extends Ethernet. It doesn't replace the Ethernet, it's 100% compliant with Ethernet, and it's optimized for east-west traffic, which is where the computing fabric is. It adds to Ethernet with an end-to-end solution with Bluefield as well as our Spectrum switch that allows us to perform some of the capabilities that we have in InfiniBand, not all but some, and we achieved excellent results. And the way we go to market is we go to market with our large enterprise partners who already offer our computing solution. And so, HPL and Lenovo have the NVIDIA AI stack, the NVIDIA enterprise software stack. And now they integrate with BlueField as well as bundle take to market their Spectrum switch and they'll be able to offer enterprise customers all over the world with their vast sales force and vast network of resellers the -- in a fully integrated, if you will, fully optimized at least end-to-end AI solution. And so, that's basically bringing AI to Ethernet for the world's enterprise. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Joe Moore of Morgan Stanley.

Q3_2024,Joe Moore,Morgan Stanley -- Analyst,"Great. Thank you. I wondered if you could talk a little bit more about Grace Hopper and how you see the ability to leverage kind of the microprocessor, how you see that as a TAM expander. And what applications do you see using Grace Hopper versus more traditional H100 applications?",neutral,0.891071916,Neutral,Neutral,0.1,0.2,0.5,0.1,0.1,Neutral
Q3_2024,Jen-Hsun Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah. Thanks for your question. Grace Hopper is in production in high-volume production now. We're expecting next year just with all of the design wins that we have in high-performance computing and AI, AI infrastructures. We are on a very, very fast ramp with our first data center CPU to a multibillion-dollar product line. This is going to be a very large product line for us. The capability of Grace Hopper is really quite spectacular. It has the ability to create compute nodes that simultaneously have very fast memory as well as very large memory. In the areas of vector databases or semantic search, what is called REG, retrieval augmented generation, so that you could have a generative AI model, be able to refer to proprietary data or factful data before it generates a response. That data is quite large. And you could also have applications or generative models where the context length is very high. You basically store an entire book into its system memory before you ask a question. And so, the context link can be quite large. This way, the degenerative models have the ability to still be able to naturally interact with you on one hand, on the other hand, be able to refer to factual data, proprietary data or domain-specific data, newer data, and be continually relevant and reduce hallucination. And so, that particular use case, for example, is really quite fantastic for Grace Hopper. It also serves the customers that really care to have a different CPU the X86, maybe it's European supercomputing centers or European companies who would like to build up their own ARM ecosystem and I'd like to build up a stack or CSPs that have decided that they would like to pivot ARM because their own custom CPUs are based on ARM. There are a variety of different reasons that drives the success of Grace Hopper, but we're off to just an extraordinary start. This is a home run product.

Q3_2024,Tim Arcuri,UBS -- Analyst,"Hi. Thanks. I wanted to ask a little bit about the visibility you have on revenue. I know there's a few moving parts, I guess, on one hand, the purchase commitments went up a lot again. But on the other hand, China bands would arguably pull in when you can fill the demand beyond China. So, I know we're not even into 2024 yet. And it doesn't sound like, Jen-Hsun, you think that next year would be a peak in your data center revenue, but I just wanted to sort of explicitly ask you that. Do you think that data center can grow even into 2025? Thanks.",neutral,0.626817584,Neutral,Neutral,0.1,0.2,0.5,0.1,0.1,Neutral
Q3_2024,Jen-Hsun Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Absolutely believe that data center can grow through 2025. And there are, of course, several reasons for that. We are expanding our supply quite significantly. We have already won the broadest and largest and most capable supply chain in the world. Remember, people think that the GPU is a chip, but the HGX, H100, the Hopper HGX has 35,000 parts. It weighs 70 pounds. Eight of the chips are Hopper. The other 35,000 are not. It is -- it has -- even its passive components are incredible, high-voltage parts, high-frequency parts, high-current parts. It is a supercomputer and therefore, the only way to test the supercomputers with another supercomputer. Even the manufacturing of it is complicated, the testing of it is complicated, the shipping event is complicated, and installation is complicated. And so, every aspect of our HGX supply chain is complicated. And the remarkable team that we have here has really scaled out the supply chain incredibly not to mention all of our HDX are connected with MBA networking and the networking, the transceivers, the mics, the cables, the switches, the amount of complexity there is just incredible. And so, I'm just -- first of all, I'm just super proud of the team for scaling up this incredible supply chain. We are absolutely world-class. But meanwhile, we're adding new customers and new products. So, we have new supply. We have new customers. As I was mentioning earlier, different regions are standing up GPU specialist clouds. Sovereign AI clouds coming up from all over the world as people realize that they can't afford to export their country's knowledge, their country's culture for somebody else to then resell AI back to them. They have to -- they should. They have the skills and fairly with us, in combination, we can help them do that, build up their national AI. And so, the first thing that they have to do is create their AI cloud national AI cloud. You're also seeing us now growing into enterprise. The enterprise market has two paths, one path, or if I could say, three paths. The first half, of course, off-the-shelf AI. And there are, of course, Chat-GPT fabulous off-the-shelf AI, there'll be others. There's also a proprietary AI because the software companies like ServiceNow and SAP and there are many, many others, I can't afford to have their company's intelligence be outsourced to somebody else. And they are about building tools. And on top of their tools, they should build custom and proprietary, and domain-specific copilots and assistants that they can rent to their customer base. This is -- they're sitting on a gold mine. Almost every major tools company in the world is sitting on gold mine, and they recognize that. They have to go build their own custom AIs. We have a new service called an AI Foundry, where we leverage NVS capabilities to be able to serve them in that. And then the next one is on enterprises building their own custom AI their own custom chatbots, their own custom. And this capability is spreading all over the world. And the way that we're going to serve that marketplace is with the entire stacks of systems, which includes our compute, our networking and our switches running our software stack called NVIDIA AI enterprise taking it through our market partners, HP, Dell, and Lenovo, so on and so forth. And so, we're just -- we're seeing the waves of generative AI starting from the start-ups and CSPs moving to consumer Internet companies moving to enterprise software platforms, moving to enterprise companies. And then -- and ultimately, one of the areas that you guys have seen us spend a lot of energy on has to do with industrial generative AI. This is where NVIDIA AI and NVIDIA Omniverse comes together. And that is a really, really exciting work. And so, I think the -- we're at the beginning of a and basically across-the-board industrial transition to generative AI to accelerated computing. This is going to affect every company, every industry, every country. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari of Goldman Sachs.

Q3_2024,Jen-Hsun Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Thanks for the question. There is a glaring opportunity in the world for AI foundry. And it makes so much sense. First, every company has its core intelligence. It makes up our company. Our data, our domain expertise. In the case of many companies, we create tools. And most of the software companies in the world are tool platforms. And those tools are used by people today. And in the future, it's going to be used by people augmented with a whole bunch of AIs that we hire. And these platforms just got to go across the world, and you'll see, and we've already announced a few SAP, ServiceNow, Dropbox, Getty, many others are coming. And the reason for that is because they have their own proprietary AI, and they want their own proprietary AI. They can't afford to outsource their intelligence and hand out their data and hand out their flywheel for other companies to build the AI for them. And so, they come to us. We have several things that are really essential in the foundry, just as TSMC is a foundry, you have to have AI technology. And as you know, we have just an incredible depth of capability, AI technology capability. And then second, you have to have the best practice known practice, the skills of processing data through the invention of AI models to create AIs that are guardrails fine-tuned, so on and so forth that are safe, so on and so forth. And the third thing is unique factories, and that's what DGX Cloud is. Our AI models are called AI foundations. Our process, if you will, our CAD systems for creating AIs are called NEMO, and they run on NVIDIA factories we call DGX Cloud. Our monetization model is that with each one of our partners, they rent a sandbox on DGX Cloud where we work together. They bring their data. They bring their domain expertise. We've got our researchers and engineers. We help them build their custom AI. We help them make that custom AI incredible. Then that customer AI becomes theirs, and they deploy it on a run time that is enterprise-grade, enterprise-optimized, or outperformance-optimized runs across everything NVIDIA. We have a giant installed base in the cloud on-prem anywhere. And it's secure, securely patched, constantly patched and optimized and supported. And we call that NVIDIA AI enterprise. NVIDIA AI Enterprise is $4,500 per GP per year. That's our business model. Our business model is basically a license. Our customers then, with that basic license, can build their monetization model on top of. In a lot of ways, we're wholesale. They become retail. They could have a per-subscription license base. They could per instance, or they could do per usage. There's a lot of different ways that they could take to create their own business model, but ours is basically like a software license like an operating system. And so, our business model is help you create your custom models, you run those custom models on NVIDIA AI Enterprise. And it's off to a great start. NVIDIA AI Enterprise is going to be a very large business for us. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein Research.

But with the absence of China, for our outlook for Q4, sure, there could have been some things that we are not supply constrained that we could have sold to China, but we no longer can.

Q3_2024,Matt Ramsay,TD Cowen -- Analyst,"Thank you very much. Congrats everybody on the results. Jen-Hsun, I had a two-part question for you, and it comes off of sort of one premise. And the premise is I still get a lot of questions from investors thinking about AI training as being NVIDIA's dominant domain and that somehow as inference, even large model inference takes more and more of the TAM that the market will become more competitive, you'll be less differentiated, etc., etc. So, I guess the two parts of the question are, number one, maybe you could spend a little bit of time talking about the evolution of the inference workload as we move to LLM and how your company is positioned for that rather than smaller model inference. And second, up until a month or two ago, I never really got any questions at all about the data processing piece of the AI workload. So, the pieces of manipulating the data before training, between training and inference, after inference. And I think that's a large part of the workload now. Maybe you could talk about how CUDA is enabling acceleration of those pieces of the workload. Thanks.",neutral,0.896469176,Neutral,Neutral,0.1,0.2,0.5,0.1,0.1,Neutral
Q3_2024,Jen-Hsun Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Sure. Inference, inference is complicated. It's actually incredibly complicated. If you â€“ we, this quarter, announced one of the most exciting new engines optimizing compilers called TensorRT LM. The reception has been incredible. You go to GitHub. It's been downloaded a ton, a whole lot of stars integrated into stacks and frameworks all over the world, almost instantaneously. And there are several reasons for that, obviously. We could create TensorRT LLM because CUDA's programmable. If CUDA and our GPUs were not so programmable, it would really be hard for us to improve software stacks at the pace that we do. TensorRT LLM on the same GPU without anybody touching anything, improves the performance by a factor of two. And then on top of that, of course, the pace of our innovation is so high. H200 increases it by another factor of two. And so, our inference performance another way of saying inference cost just reduced by a factor of four within about a year's time. And so, that's really, really hard to keep up with. Now, the reason why everybody likes our inference engine is because our installed base. And we've been dedicated to our installed base for 20 years, 20-plus years. We have an installed base that is not only largest in every single cloud, it's in every available from every enterprise system maker. It's used by companies of just about every industry. And any time you see an NVIDIA GPU, it runs our stack. It's architecturally compatible. It's something we've been dedicated to for a very long time. We're very disciplined about it. We make it, if you will, architecture compatibility is job one. And that has conveyed to the world the certainty of our platform stability. NVIDIA's platform stability certainty is the reason why everybody builds on us first and the reason why everybody optimizes on us first. All the engineering and all the work that you do, all the invention of technologies that you build on top of NVIDIA accrues to the -- and benefits everybody that uses our GPUs, and we have such a large installed base, millions and millions of GPUs in cloud, 100 million GPU from people's PCs, just about every workstation in the world, and they're all architecturally compatible. And so, if you're an inference platform and you are deploying an inference application, you are basically an application provider and as a software application provider, and you're looking for a large installed base. Data processing, before you could train a model, you have to augment the data. You have to debug the data, maybe you have to augment the data with synthetic data. So, you process that they clean the data, align the data, normalize the data, all of that data is measured not in bites and megabytes. It's measured in terabytes and petabytes. And the amount of data processing that you do before data engineering before that you do training is quite significant. It could represent 30%, 40%, 50% of the amount of work that you ultimately do. In what you -- in ultimately creating a data-driven machine learning service. And so, data processing is just a massive part. We accelerate Spark. We accelerate Python. One of the coolest things that we just did, it's called cuDF Pandas. Without one line of code, Pandas, which is the single most successful data science framework in the world, Pandas now is accelerated by NVIDIA CUDA and just out of the box without the line of code. And so, the acceleration is really quite terrific. And people are just incredibly excited about. And Pandas was designed for one purpose and one purpose only really data processing for data science. And so, NVIDIA CUDA gives you all of that. Operator Your final question comes from the line of Harlan Sur of JPMorgan.

But more importantly, what is the team doing to manage and drive execution through all of this complexity?",neutral,0.687753737,Neutral,Neutral,0.1,0.2,0.5,0.1,0.1,Neutral
Q3_2024,Jen-Hsun Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Gosh, you know, boy, that's just really excellent. You just wrote NVIDIA's business plan. And you described our strategy. First of all, there is a fundamental reason why we accelerate our execution. And the reason for that is because it fundamentally drives down cost. When the combination of TensorRT LLM and 200 reduced the cost for our customers for large model inference by a factor of four. And so, that includes, of course, our speeds and feeds, but mostly it's because of our software, mostly the software benefits because of the architecture. And so, we want to accelerate our road map for that reason. The second reason is to expand the reach of generative AI. The world's number of data center configurations, this is kind of the amazing thing. NVIDIA is in every cloud, but not one cloud is the same. NVIDIA is working with every single cloud service provider and not one of their networking control plane security posture is the same. Everybody's platform is different. And yet we're integrated into all of their stacks, all of their data centers, and we work incredibly well with all of them. And not to mention, we didn't take the whole thing, and we create AI factories that are stand-alone. We take our platform. We can put them into supercomputers. We can put them into enterprise. Bringing AI to enterprise is something generative AI to enterprise something nobody has ever done before. And we're right now in the process of going to market with all of that. And so, the complexity includes, of course, all the technologies and segments and the pace, it includes the fact that we are architecturally compatible across every single one of those. And it's all of the domain-specific libraries that we create. The reason why you -- every computer company, without thinking, can integrate NVIDIA into their road map and take it to market, and the reason for that is because there's market demand for it. There's market demand and healthcare. There's market demand in manufacturing, there's market demand, and of course, in AI, in financial services and supercomputing, and quantum computing. The list of markets and segments that we have domain-specific libraries is incredibly broad. And then finally, now we have an end-to-end solution for data centers. InfiniBand network, InfiniBand networking, Ethernet networking, x86 ARM, just about every permutation combination of solutions, technology solutions, and software stacks provided. And that translates to having the largest number of ecosystem software developers, the largest ecosystem of system makers, the largest and broadest distribution partnership network, and ultimately, the greatest reach. And that takes â€“ surely, that takes a lot of energy. But the thing that really holds together, and this is -- this is a great decision that we made decades ago, which is everything is architecturally compatible. When you -- when we develop a domain-specific language that runs on one GPU, it runs on every GPU. When we optimize TensorRT for the cloud, we optimize it for enterprise. When we do something that brings in a new feature, a new library, a new feature, or a new developer, they instantly get the benefit of all of our reach. And so, that discipline, that architecture-compatible discipline that has lasted more than a couple of decades now is one of the reasons why NVIDIA is still really, really efficient. I mean, we're 28,000 people large and serving just about every single company, every single industry, every single market around the world. Operator Thank you.

Q3_2024,Jen-Hsun Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Our strong growth reflects the broad industry platform transition from general-purpose to accelerated computing and Generative AI. Large language model start-ups, consumer Internet companies, and global cut service providers are the first movers. The next waves are starting to build. Nations and regional CSPs are building AI clouds to serve local demand. Enterprise software companies like Adobe and Dropbox, SAP, and ServiceNow are adding AI copilots and assistants to their platforms. And enterprises in the world's largest industries are creating custom AIs to automate and boost productivity. The generative AI era is in full steam and has created the need for a new type of data center and AI factory, optimized for refining data and training and inference and generating AI. AI factory workloads are different and incremental to legacy data center workloads supporting IT tasks. AI factories run copilots and AI assistants, which are significant software TAM expansion and are driving significant new investment, expanding the $1 trillion traditional data center infrastructure installed base, empowering the AI industrial revolution. NVIDIA H100 HGX with InfiniBand and the NVIDIA AI software stack defined an AI factory today. As we expand our supply chain to meet the world's demand, we are also building new growth drivers for the next wave of AI. We highlighted three elements to our new growth strategy that are hitting their stride, CPU, networking, and software and services. Grace is NVIDIA first, data center CPU. Grace and Grace Hopper are in full production and ramping into a new multibillion-dollar product line next year, irrespective of the CPU choice. We can help customers build an AI factory. NVIDIA networking now exceeds a $10 billion annualized revenue run rate. InfiniBand grew fivefold year over year and is positioned for excellent growth ahead as the networking of AI factories.

Full year revenue was $27 billion, flat from the prior year. Starting with data center. Revenue was $3.62 billion was down 6% sequentially and up 11% year on year. Fiscal year revenue was $15 billion and up 41%. Hyperscale customer revenue posted strong sequential growth, though short of our expectations as some cloud service providers paused at the end of the year to recalibrate their build plans. Though we generally see tightening that reflects overall macroeconomic uncertainty, we believe this is a timing issue as the end market demand for GPUs and AI infrastructure is strong. Networking grew but a bit less than our expected on softer demand for general purpose CPU infrastructure. The total data center sequential revenue decline was driven by lower sales in China, which was largely in line with our expectations, reflecting COVID and other domestic issues. With cloud adoption continuing to grow, we are serving an expanding list of fast-growing cloud service providers, including Oracle and GPU specialized CSPs. Revenue growth from CSP customers last year significantly outpaced that of data center as a whole as more enterprise customers moved to a cloud-first approach. On a trailing four-quarter basis, CSP customers drove about 40% of our data center revenue. Adoption of our new flagship H100 center GPU is strong. In just the second quarter of its ramp, H100 revenue was already much higher than that of A100, which declined sequentially. This is a testament of the exceptional performance on the H100, which is as much as nine x faster than the A100 for training and up 30x cluster in inferencing of transformer-based large language models. The transformer engine of H100 arrived just in time to serve the development and scale out of inference of large language models. AI adoption is at an inflection point. Open AI's ChatGPT has captured interest worldwide, allowing people to experience AI firsthand and showing what's possible with generative AI. These new types of neural network models can improve productivity in a wide range of tasks, whether generating text like marketing copy, summarizing documents like , creating images for ads or video games or answering customer questions. Generative AI applications will help almost every industry do more faster. Generative large language models with over 100 billion parameters are the most advanced neural networks in today's world. NVIDIA's expertise spans across the AI supercomputers, algorithms, data processing and training methods that can bring these capabilities to enterprise. We look forward to helping customers with generative AI opportunities. In addition to working with every major hyperscale cloud provider, we are engaged with many consumer Internet companies, enterprises, and start-ups. The opportunity is significant and driving strong growth in the data center that will accelerate through the year. During the quarter, we made notable announcements in the financial services sector, one of our largest industry verticals. We announced a partnership with Deutsche Bank to accelerate the use of AI and machine learning in financial services. Together, we are developing a range of applications, including virtual customer service agents, speech AI, fraud detection, and bank process automation, leveraging NVIDIA's full computing stack, both on-premise and in the cloud, including NVIDIA, AI enterprise software. We also announced that NVIDIA captured leading results for AI inference in a key financial services industry benchmark for applications such as asset price discovery. In networking, we see growing demand for our latest generation InfiniBand and HPC optimized Ethernet platforms fueled by AI. Generative AI foundation model sizes continue to grow at exponential rates, driving the need for high-performance networking to scale out multi-node accelerated workloads. Delivering unmatched performance, latency, and in-network computing capabilities, InfiniBand is the clear choice for power-efficient cloud scale, generative AI. For smaller scale deployments, NVIDIA is bringing its full accelerated stack expertise and integrating it with the world's most advanced high-performance Ethernet fabrics. In the quarter, InfiniBand led our growth as our Quantum-2 40 gigabit per second platform is off to a great start, driven by demand across cloud, enterprise and supercomputing customers. In Ethernet, our 40 gigabits per second Spectrum-4 networking platform is gaining momentum as customers transition to higher speeds, next-generation adopters, and switches. We remain focused on expanding our software and services. We released version 3.0 of NVIDIA AI enterprise with support for more than 50 NVIDIA AI frameworks and pretrained model and new workflows for contact center, intelligent virtual assistance, audio transcription and cybersecurity. Upcoming offerings include our NeMo and BioNeMo large language model services, which are currently in early access with customers. Now to Jensen to talk a bit more about our software and cloud business.",positive,0.843086779,Slightly Positive,Neutral,0,0.1,0.8,0.1,0,Neutral
Q4_2023,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Thanks, Colette. The accumulation of technology breakthroughs has brought AI to an inflection point. Generative AI's versatility and capability has triggered a sense of urgency at enterprises around the world to develop and deploy AI strategies.

Q4_2023,Colette Kress,"Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Jensen. Gaming revenue of $1.83 billion was up 16% sequentially and down 46% from a year ago. Fiscal year revenue of $9.07 billion is down 27%. Sequential growth was driven by the strong reception of our 40 Series GeForce RTX GPUs based on the Ada Lovelace architecture. The year-on-year decline reflects the impact of channel inventory correction, which is largely behind us. And demand in the seasonally strong fourth quarter was solid in most regions. While China was somewhat impacted by disruptions related to COVID, we are encouraged by the early signs of recovery in that market. Gamers are responding enthusiastically to the new RTX4090, 4080, 4070 Ti desktop GPUs, with many retail and online outlets quickly selling out of stock. The flagship RTX 4090 has quickly shot up in popularity on Steam to claim the top spot for the AI architecture, reflecting gamers' desire for high-performance graphic. Earlier this month, the first phase of gaming laptops based on the Ada architecture reached retail shelves, delivering NVIDIA's largest-ever generational leap in performance and power efficiency. For the first time, we are bringing enthusiast-class GPU performance to laptops as slim as 14 inches, a fast-growing segment, previously limited to basic tasks and apps. In another first, we are bringing the 90 class GPUs, our most performing models, to laptops, thanks to the power efficiency of our fifth-generation Max-Q technology. All in, RTX 40 Series GPUs will power over 170 gaming and creator laptops, setting up for a great back-to-school season. There are now over 400 games and applications supporting NVIDIA's RTX technology for real-time ray tracing and AI-powered graphics. The AI architecture features DLSS 3, our third-generation AI-powered graphics, which massively boosts performance. With the most advanced games, Cyberpunk 2077, recently added DLSS 3 enabling three to four x boosts in frame rate performance at 4K resolution. Our GeForce Now cloud gaming service continued to expand in multiple dimensions, users, titles, and performance. It now has more than 25 million members in over 100 countries. Last month, it enabled RTX 4080 graphics horsepower in the new high-performance ultimate membership tier. Ultimate members can stream at up to 240 frames per second from a cloud with full ray tracing and DLSS 3. And just yesterday, we made an important announcement with Microsoft. We agreed to a 10-year partnership to bring to GeForce Now Microsoft's lineup of Xbox PC games, which includes blockbusters like Minecraft, Halo and Flight Simulator. And upon the close of Microsoft's Activision acquisition, it will add titles like Call of Duty and Overwatch. Moving to pro visualization. Revenue of $226 million was up 13% sequentially and down 65% from a year ago. Fiscal year revenue of $1.54 billion was down 27%. Sequential growth was driven by desktop workstations with strengths in the automotive and manufacturing industrial verticals. Year-on-year decline reflects the impact of the channel inventory correction, which we expect to end in the first half of the year. Interest in NVIDIA's Omniverse continues to build with almost 300,000 downloads so far, 185 connectors to third-party design applications. The latest released Omniverse has a number of features and enhancements, including support for 4K, real-time path tracing, Omniverse Search for AI-powered search through large untagged 3D databases, and Omniverse cloud containers for AWS. Let's move to automotive. Revenue was a record $294 million, up 17% and up 135% from a year ago. Sequential growth was driven primarily by AI automotive solutions. New program ramps at both electric vehicle and traditional OEM customers helped drive this growth. Fiscal year revenue of $903 million was up 60%. At CES, we announced a strategic partnership with Foxconn to develop automated and autonomous vehicle platforms. This partnership will provide scale for volume, manufacturing to meet growing demand for the NVIDIA Drive platform. Foxconn will use NVIDIA Drive, Hyperion compute, and sensor architecture for its electric vehicles. Foxconn will be a Tier 1 manufacturer producing electronic control units based on NVIDIA Drive Orin for the global automotive vehicles. We also reached an important milestone this quarter. The NVIDIA Drive operating system received safety certification from TUV SUD, one of the most experienced and rigorous assessment bodies in the automotive industry. With industry-leading performance and functional safety, our platform meets the higher standards required for autonomous transportation. Moving to the rest of the P&L. GAAP gross margin was 63.3%, and non-GAAP gross margin was 66.1%. Fiscal year GAAP gross margin was 56.9%, and non-GAAP gross margin was 59.2%. Year on year, Q4 GAAP operating expenses were up 21%, and non-GAAP operating expenses were up 23%, primarily due to the higher compensation and data center infrastructure expenses. Sequentially, GAAP operating expenses were flat, and non-GAAP operating expenses were down 1%. We plan to keep them relatively flat at this level over the coming quarters. Full year GAAP operating expenses were up 50%, and non-GAAP operating expenses were up 31%. We returned $1.15 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and cash dividends. At the end of Q4, we had approximately %7 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization through December 2023. Let me look to the outlook for the first quarter of fiscal '24. We expect sequential growth to be driven by each of our four major market platforms led by strong growth in data center and gaming. Revenue is expected to be $6.5 billion, plus or minus 2%. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 64.1% and 66.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $2.53 billion. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $1.78 billion. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be an income of approximately $50 million, excluding gains and losses of nonaffiliated divestments. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 13%, plus or minus 1%, excluding any discrete items. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $350 million to $400 million for the first quarter and in the range of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion for the full fiscal year 2024. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website. In closing, let me highlight upcoming events for the financial community. We will be attending the Morgan Stanley Technology Conference on March 6th in San Francisco and the Cowen Healthcare Conference on March 7th in Boston. We will also host GTC virtually with Jensen's keynote kicking off on March 21st. Our earnings call to discuss the results of our first quarter of fiscal year '24 is scheduled for Wednesday, May 24th.

Q4_2023,Aaron Rakers,Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst,"Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. Clearly, on this call, a key focal point is going to be the monetization effect of your software and cloud strategy. I think as we look at it, I think, straight up, the enterprise AI software suite, I think, is priced at around $6,000 per CPU socket. I think you've got pricing metrics a little bit higher for the cloud consumption model. I'm just curious, Colette, how do we start to think about that monetization contribution to the company's business model over the next couple of quarters relative to, I think, in the past, you've talked like a couple of hundred million or so?

Q4_2023,Colette Kress,"Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","So I'll start and turn it over to Jensen to talk more because I believe this will be a great topic and discussion also at our GTC. Our plans in terms of software, we continue to see growth even in our Q4 results, we're making quite good progress in both working with our partners, onboarding more partners and increasing our software. You are correct. We've talked about our software revenues being in the hundreds of millions. And we're getting even stronger each day as Q4 was probably a record level in terms of our software levels. But there's more to unpack in terms of there, and I'm going to turn it to Jensen.",positive,0.678121328,Slightly Positive,Slightly Positive,0.2,0.4,0.3,0.1,0,Strong Positive
Q4_2023,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah. First of all, taking a step back, NVIDIA AI is essentially the operating system of AI systems today. It starts from data processing to learning, training, to validations, to inference. And so this body of software is completely accelerated. It runs in every cloud. It runs on-prem. And it supports every framework, every model that we know of, and it's accelerated everywhere. By using NVIDIA AI, your entire machine learning operations is more efficient, and it is more cost effective. You save money by using accelerated software. Our announcement today of putting NVIDIA's infrastructure and have it be hosted from within the world's leading cloud service providers accelerates the enterprise's ability to utilize NVIDIA AI enterprise. It accelerates people's adoption of this machine-learning pipeline, which is not for the faint of heart. It is a very extensive body of software. It is not deployed in enterprises broadly, but we believe that by hosting everything in the cloud, from the infrastructure through the operating system software, all the way through pretrained models, we can accelerate the adoption of generative AI in enterprises. And so we're excited about this new extended part of our business model. We really believe that it will accelerate the adoption of software.

Q4_2023,Vivek Arya,Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst,"Thank you. Just wanted to clarify, Colette, if you meant data center could grow on a year-on-year basis also in Q1? And then Jensen, my main question kind of relate to two small related ones. The computing intensity for generative AI, if it is very high, does it limit the market size to just a handful of hyperscalers? And on the other extreme, if the market gets very large, then doesn't it attract more competition for NVIDIA from cloud ASICs or other accelerator options that are out there in the market?",neutral,0.890632153,Neutral,Neutral,0.1,0.2,0.5,0.1,0.1,Neutral
Q4_2023,Colette Kress,"Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Thanks for the question. First, talking about our data center guidance that we provided for Q1. We do expect a sequential growth in terms of our data center, strong sequential growth. And we are also expecting a growth year over year for our data center. We actually expect a great year. If our year-over-year growth in data center probably accelerated past Q1.",positive,0.937651575,Strong Positive,Slightly Positive,0.2,0.4,0.3,0.1,0,Slightly Positive
Q4_2023,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Large language models are called large because they are quite large. However, remember that we've accelerated and advanced AI processing by a million x over the last decade. Moore's Law, in its best days, would have delivered 100x in a decade. By coming up with new processors, new systems, new interconnects, new frameworks and algorithms, and working with data scientists, AI researchers on new models, across that entire span, we've made large language model processing a million times faster, a million times faster. What would have taken a couple of months in the beginning, now it happens in about 10 days. And of course, you still need a large infrastructure. And even the large infrastructure, we're introducing Hopper, which, with its transformer engine, its new NVLink switches and its new InfiniBand 400 gigabits per second data rates, we're able to take another leap in the processing of large language models. And so I think the -- by putting NVIDIA's DGX supercomputers into the cloud with NVIDIA DGX cloud, we're going to democratize the access of this infrastructure, and with accelerated training capabilities, really make this technology and this capability quite accessible. So that's one thought. The second is the number of large language models or foundation models that have to be developed is quite large. Different countries with different cultures and its body of knowledge are different. Different fields, different domains, whether it's imaging or its biology or its physics, each one of them need their own domain of foundation models. With large language models, of course, we now have a prior that could be used to accelerate the development of all these other fields, which is really quite exciting. The other thing to remember is that the number of companies in the world have their own proprietary data. The most valuable data in the world are proprietary. And they belong to the company. It's inside their company. It will never leave the company. And that body of data will also be harnessed to train new AI models for the very first time. And so we -- our strategy and our goal is to put the DGX infrastructure in the cloud so that we can make this capability available to every enterprise, every company in the world who would like to create proprietary data and so -- proprietary models. The second thing about competition. We've had competition for a long time. Our approach, our computing architecture, as you know, is quite different on several dimensions. Number one, it is universal, meaning you could use it for training, you can use it for inference, you can use it for models of all different types. It supports every framework. It supports every cloud. It's everywhere. It's cloud to private cloud, cloud to on-prem. It's all the way out to the edge. It could be an autonomous system. This one architecture allows developers to develop their AI models and deploy it everywhere. The second very large idea is that no AI in itself is an application. There's a preprocessing part of it and a post-processing part of it to turn it into an application or service. Most people don't talk about the pre and post processing because it's maybe not as sexy and not as interesting. However, it turns out that preprocessing and post-processing oftentimes consumes half or two-thirds of the overall workload. And so by accelerating the entire end-to-end pipeline, from preprocessing, from data ingestion, data processing, all the way to the preprocessing all the way to post processing, we're able to accelerate the entire pipeline versus just accelerating half of the pipeline. The limit to speed up, even if you're instantly passed if you only accelerate half of the workload, is twice as fast. Whereas if you accelerate the entire workload, you could accelerate the workload maybe 10, 20, 50 times faster, which is the reason why when you hear about NVIDIA accelerating applications, you routinely hear 10x, 20x, 50x speed up. And the reason for that is because we accelerate things end to end, not just the deep learning part of it, but using CUDA to accelerate everything from end to end. And so I think the universality of our computing -- accelerated computing platform, the fact that we're in every cloud, the fact that we're from cloud to edge, makes our architecture really quite accessible and very differentiated in this way. And most importantly, to all the service providers, because of the utilization is so high, because you can use it to accelerate the end-to-end workload and get such a good throughput, our architecture is the lowest operating cost. It's not -- the comparison is not even close. So -- and yes, those are the two answers. Operator Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore. Your line is now open.",neutral,0.921282291,Neutral,Slightly Positive,0.2,0.4,0.3,0.1,0,Strong Positive
Q4_2023,C.J. Muse,Evercore ISI -- Analyst,"Yeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess, Jensen, you talked about ChatGPT as an inflection point kind of like the iPhone. And so curious, part A, how have your conversations evolved post ChatGPT with hyperscale and large-scale enterprises? And then secondly, as you think about Hopper with the transformative engine and Grace with high-bandwidth memory, how have you kind of your outlook for growth for those two product cycles evolved in the last few months? Thanks so much.",neutral,0.811687827,Neutral,Neutral,0.1,0.2,0.5,0.1,0.1,Neutral
Q4_2023,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,"ChatGPT is a wonderful piece of work, and the team did a great job, OpenAI did a great job with it. They stuck with it. And the accumulation of all of the breakthroughs led to a service with a model inside that surprised everybody with its versatility and its capability. What people were surprised by, and this is in our -- and close within the industry is well understood. But the surprising capability of a single AI model that can perform tasks and skills that it was never trained to do. And for this language model to not just speak English, or can translate, of course, but not just speak human language, it can be prompted in human language, but output Python, output Cobalt, a language that very few people even remember, output Python for Blender, a 3D program. So it's a program that writes a program for another program. We now realize -- the world now realizes that maybe human language is a perfectly good computer programming language, and that we've democratized computer programming for everyone, almost anyone who could explain in human language a particular task to be performed. This new computer -- when I say new era of computing, this new computing platform, this new computer could take whatever your prompt is, whatever your human-explained request is, and translate it to a sequence of instructions that you process it directly, or it waits for you to decide whether you want to process it or not. And so this type of computer is utterly revolutionary in its application because it's democratized programming to so many people really has excited enterprises all over the world. Every single CSP, every single Internet service provider, and they're, frankly, every single software company, because of what I just explained, that this is an AI model that can write a program for any program. Because of that reason, everybody who develops software is either alerted or shocked into alert or actively working on something that is like ChatGPT to be integrated into their application or integrated into their service. And so this is, as you can imagine, utterly worldwide. The activity around the AI infrastructure that we build Hopper and the activity around inferencing using Hopper and Ampere to inference large language models, has just gone through the roof in the last 60 days. And so there's no question that whatever our views are of this year as we enter the year has been fairly, dramatically changed as a result of the last 60, 90 days.

Q4_2023,Matt Ramsay,Cowen and Company -- Analyst,"Thank you very much. Good afternoon. Jensen, I wanted to ask a couple of questions on the DGX Cloud. And I guess, we're all talking about the drivers of the services and the compute that you're going to host on top of these services with the different hyperscalers. But I think we've been kind of watching and wondering when your data center business might transition to more of a systems level business, meaning pairing and D-Link InfiniBand with your Hopper product, with your Grace product, and selling things more on a systems level. I wonder if you could step back, over the next two or three years, how do you think the mix of business in your data center segment evolves from maybe selling cards to systems and software? And what can that mean for the margins of that business over time? Thank you.",neutral,0.893268049,Neutral,Neutral,0.1,0.2,0.5,0.1,0.1,Neutral
Q4_2023,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah. I appreciate the question. First of all, as you know, our data center business is a GPU business only in the context of a conceptual GPU because what we actually sell to the cloud service providers is a panel, a fairly large computing panel of eight Hoppers or eight Amperes that's connected with NVLink switches that are connected with NVLink. And so this board represents essentially one GPU. It's eight chips connected together into one GPU with a very high-speed chip-to-chip interconnect. And so we've been working on, if you will, multi-die computers for quite some time. And that is one GPU. So when we think about a GPU, we actually think about an HGX GPU, and that's 8 GPUs. We're going to continue to do that. And the thing that the cloud service providers are really excited about is by hosting our infrastructure for NVIDIA to offer because we have so many companies that we work directly with. We're working directly with 10,000 AI start-ups around the world, with enterprises in every industry. And all of those relationships today would really love to be able to deploy both into the cloud at least or into the cloud and on-prem and oftentimes multi-cloud. And so by having NVIDIA DGX and NVIDIA's infrastructure are full stack in their cloud, we're effectively attracting customers to the CSPs. This is a very, very exciting model for them. And they welcomed us with open arms. And we're going to be the best AI salespeople for the world's clouds. And for the customers, they now have an instantaneous infrastructure that is the most advanced. They have a team of people who are extremely good from the infrastructure to the acceleration software, the NVIDIA AI open operating system, all the way up to AI models. Within one entity, they have access to expertise across that entire span. And so this is a great model for customers. It's a great model for CSPs. And it's a great model for us. It lets us really run like the wind. As much as we will continue and continue to advance DGX AI supercomputers, it does take time to build AI supercomputers on-prem. It's hard no matter how you look at it. It takes time no matter how you look at it. And so now we have the ability to really prefetch a lot of that and get customers up and running as fast as possible. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Your line is now open.",neutral,0.935137212,Neutral,Slightly Positive,0.2,0.4,0.3,0.1,0,Strong Positive
Q4_2023,Timothy Arcuri,UBS -- Analyst,"Thanks a lot. Jensen, I had a question about what this all does to your TAM. Most of the focus right now is on text, but obviously, there are companies doing a lot of training on video and music. They're working on models there. And it seems like somebody who's training these big models has maybe, on the high end, at least 10,000 GPUs in the cloud that they've contracted and maybe tens of thousands of more to inference a widely deployed model. So it seems like the incremental TAM is easily in the several hundred thousands of GPUs and easily in the tens of billions of dollars. But I'm kind of wondering what this does to the TAM numbers you gave last year. I think you said $300 billion hardware TAM and $300 billion software TAM. So how do you kind of think about what the new TAM would be? Thanks.",neutral,0.918729067,Neutral,Neutral,0.1,0.2,0.5,0.1,0.1,Neutral
Q4_2023,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,"I think those numbers are really good anchor still. The difference is because of the, if you will, incredible capabilities and versatility of generative AI and all of the converging breakthroughs that happened toward the middle and the end of last year, we're probably going to arrive at that TAM sooner than later. There's no question that this is a very big moment for the computer industry. Every single platform change, every inflection point in the way that people develop computers happened because it was easier to use, easier to program and more accessible. This happened with the PC revolution. This happened with the Internet revolution. This happened with mobile cloud. Remember, mobile cloud, because of the iPhone and the App Store, 5 million applications and counting emerged. There weren't 5 million mainframe applications. There weren't 5 million workstation applications. There weren't 5 million PC applications. And because it was so easy to develop and deploy amazing applications part cloud, part on the mobile device and so easy to distribute because of app stores, the same exact thing is now happening to AI. In no computing era did one computing platform, ChatGPT, reached 150 million people in 60, 90 days. I mean, this is quite an extraordinary thing. And people are using it to create all kinds of things. And so I think that what you're seeing now is just a torrent of new companies and new applications that are emerging. There's no question this is, in every way, a new computing era. And so I think this -- the TAM that we explained and expressed, it really is even more realizable today and sooner than before.

We began initial shipments of H100 back in Q3. It was a great start. Many of them began that process many quarters ago. And this was a time for us to get production level to them in Q3. So Q4 was an important time for us to see a great ramp of H100 that we saw. What that means is our H100 was the focus of many of our CSPs within Q4, and they were all wanting to get both get up and running in cloud instances. And so we actually saw less of A100 in Q4 of what we saw in H100 at a larger amount. We tend to continue to sell both architectures going forward, but just in Q4, it was a strong quarter for H100. Your additional questions that you had on Mercedes Benz. I'm very pleased with the joint connection that we have with them and the work. We've been working very diligently about getting ready to come to market. And you're right. They did talk about the software opportunity. They talked about their software opportunity in two phases, about what they can do with Drive as well as what they can also do with Connect. They extended out to a position of probably about 10 years looking at the opportunity that they see in front of us. So it aligns with what our thoughts are with a long-term partner of that and sharing that revenue over time.",positive,0.633889496,Slightly Positive,Slightly Positive,0.2,0.4,0.3,0.1,0,Slightly Positive
Q4_2023,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,"One of the things that, if I could add, Stacy, to say something about the wisdom of what Mercedes is doing. This is the only large luxury brand that has, across the board, from every -- from the entry all the way to the highest end of their luxury cars, to install every single one of them with a rich sensor set, every single one of them with an AI supercomputer, so that every future car in the Mercedes fleet will contribute to an installed base that could be upgradable and forever renewed for customers going forward. If you could just imagine what it looks like if the entire Mercedes fleet that is on the road today were completely programmable, that you can OTA, it would represent tens of millions of Mercedeses that would represent revenue-generating opportunity. And that's the vision that Ola has. And what they're building for, I think, it's going to be extraordinary. The large installed base of luxury cars that will continue to renew with -- for customers' benefits and also for revenue-generating benefits.

Q4_2023,Mark Lipacis,Jefferies -- Analyst,"Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I think for you, Jensen, it seems like every year a new workload comes out and drives demand for your process or your ecosystem cycles. And if I think back facial recognition and then recommendation engines, natural language processing, Omniverse and now generative AI engines, can you share with us your view? Is this what we should expect going forward, like a brand-new workload that drives demand to the next level for your products? And the reason I ask is because I found it interesting your comments in your script where you mentioned that your kind of view about the demand that generative AI is going to drive for your products and now services is -- seems to be a lot, better than what you thought just over the last 90 days. So -- and to the extent that there's new workloads that you're working on or new applications that can drive next levels of demand, would you care to share with us a little bit of what you think could drive it past what you're seeing today? Thank you.",neutral,0.874379933,Neutral,Neutral,0.1,0.2,0.5,0.1,0.1,Neutral
Q4_2023,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Yes, Mark. I really appreciate the question. First of all, I have new applications that you don't know about and new workloads that we've never shared that I would like to share with you at GTC. And so that's my hook to come to GTC, and I think you're going to be very surprised and quite delighted by the applications that we're going to talk about. Now there's a reason why it is the case that you're constantly hearing about new applications. The reason for that is, number one, NVIDIA is a multi-domain accelerated computing platform. It is not completely general purpose like a CPU because a CPU is 95%, 98% control functions and only 2% mathematics, which makes it completely flexible. We're not that way. We're an accelerated computing platform that works with the CPU that offloads the really heavy computing units, things that could be highly, highly paralyzed to offload them. But we're multi-domain. We could do particle systems. We could do fluids. We could do neurons. And we can do computer graphics. We can do race. There are all kinds of different applications that we can accelerate, number one. Number two, our installed base is so large. This is the only accelerated computing platform, the only platform. Literally, the only one that is architecturally compatible across every single cloud from PCs to workstations, gamers to cars to on-prem. Every single computer is architecturally compatible, which means that a developer who developed something special would seek out our platform because they like the reach. They like the universal reach. They like the acceleration, number one. They like the ecosystem of programming tools and the ease of using it and the fact that they have so many people they can reach out to, to help them. There are millions of CUDA experts around the world, software all accelerated, tool all accelerated. And then very importantly, they like the reach. They like the fact that you can see -- they can reach so many users after they develop the software. And it is the reason why we just keep attracting new applications. And then finally, this is a very important point. Remember, the rate of CPU computing advance has slowed tremendously. And whereas back in the first 30 years of my career, at 10x in performance at about the same power every five years and then 10x every five years. That rate of continued advance has slowed. At a time when people still have really, really urging applications that they would like to bring to the world, and they can't afford to do that with the power keep going up. Everybody needs to be sustainable. You can't continue to consume power. By accelerating it, we can decrease the amount of power you use for any workload. And so all of these multitude of reasons is really driving people to use accelerated computing, and we keep discovering new exciting applications.

Q4_2023,Atif Malik,Citi -- Analyst,"Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Colette, I have a question on data center. You saw some weakness on build plan in the January quarter, but you're guiding to year-over-year acceleration in April and through the year. So if you can just rank order for us the confidence in the acceleration. Is that based on your H100 ramp or generative AI sales coming through or the new AI services model? And also, if you can talk about what you're seeing on the enterprise vertical.",neutral,0.836333632,Neutral,Neutral,0.1,0.2,0.5,0.1,0.1,Slightly Negative
Q4_2023,Colette Kress,"Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Sure. Thanks for the question. When we think about our growth, yes, we're going to grow sequentially in Q1 and do expect year-over-year growth in Q1 as well. It will likely accelerate there going forward. So what do we see as the drivers of that? Yes, we have multiple product cycles coming to market. We have H100 in market now. We are continuing with our new launches as well that are sometimes fueled with our GPU computing with our networking. And then we have grades coming likely in the second half of the year. Additionally, generative AI, it's sparked interest definitely among our customers, whether those be CSPs, whether those be enterprises, one of those be start-ups. We expect that to be a part of our revenue growth this year. And then lastly, let's just not forget that given the end of Moore's Law, there's an error here of focusing on AI, focusing on accelerated continuing. So as the economy improves, this is probably very important to the enterprises and it can be fueled by the existence of cloud first for the enterprises as they .

Q4_2023,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,No. You did great. That was great. Operator Your last question today comes from the line of Joseph Moore with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.,neutral,0.919443369,Neutral,Neutral,0.1,0.2,0.5,0.1,0.1,Neutral
Q4_2023,Joseph Moore,Morgan Stanley -- Analyst,"Great. Thank you. Jensen, you talked about the sort of 1 million times improvement in your ability to train these models over the last decade. Can you give us some insight into what that looks like in the next few years and to the extent that some of your customers with these large language models are talking about 100x the complexity over that kind of time frame. I know Hopper is six x better transformer performance. But what can you do to scale that up? And how much of that just reflects that it's going to be a much larger hardware expense down the road?",neutral,0.697803915,Neutral,Neutral,0.1,0.2,0.5,0.1,0.1,Neutral
Q4_2023,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,"First, I'll start backwards. I believe the number of AI infrastructures are going to grow all over the world. And the reason for that is AI, the production of intelligence, is going to be manufacturing. There was a time when people manufacture just physical goods. In the future, there will be -- almost every company will manufacture soft goods. It just happens to be in the form of intelligence. Data comes in. That data center does exactly one thing and one thing only. It cranks on that data and it produces a new updated model. Where raw material comes in, a building or an infrastructure cranks on it, and something refined or improved comes out that is of great value, that's called the factory. And so I expect to see AI factories all over the world. Some of it will be hosted in cloud. Some of it will be on-prem. There will be some that are large, and there are some that will be mega large, and then there'll be some that are smaller. And so I fully expect that to happen, number one. Number two. Over the course of the next 10 years, I hope through new chips, new interconnects, new systems, new operating systems, new distributed computing algorithms and new AI algorithms and working with developers coming up with new models, I believe we're going to accelerate AI by another million x. There's a lot of ways for us to do that. And that's one of the reasons why NVIDIA is not just a chip company because the problem we're trying to solve is just too complex. You have to think across the entire stack all the way from the chip, all the way into the data center across the network through the software. And in the mind of one single company, we can think across that entire stack. And it's really quite a great playground for computer scientists for that reason because we can innovate across that entire stack. So my expectation is that you're going to see really gigantic breakthroughs in AI models in the next company, the AI platforms in the coming decade. But simultaneously, because of the incredible growth and adoption of this, you're going to see these AI factories everywhere. Operator This concludes our Q&A session. I will now turn the call back over to Jensen Huang for closing remarks.",neutral,0.924459994,Neutral,Slightly Positive,0.2,0.4,0.3,0.1,0,Strong Positive
Q4_2023,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Thank you. The accumulation of breakthroughs from transformers, large language model and generative AI has elevated the capability and versatility of AI to a remarkable level. A new computing platform has emerged. New companies, new applications and new solutions to long-standing challenges are being invented at an astounding rate. Enterprises in just about every industry are activating to apply generative AI to reimagine their products and businesses. The level of activity around AI, which was already high, has accelerated significantly. This is the moment we've been working toward for over a decade. And we are ready. Our Hopper AI supercomputer with the new transformer engine and Quantum InfiniBand fabric is in full production, and CSPs are racing to open their Hopper cloud services. As we work to meet the strong demand for our GPUs, we look forward to accelerating growth through the year. Don't miss the upcoming GTC. We have much to tell you about new chips, systems and software, new CUDA applications and customers, new ecosystem partners and a lot more on NVIDIA AI and Omniverse. This will be our best GTC yet.
