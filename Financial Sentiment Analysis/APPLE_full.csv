Q1_2025,Suhasini Chandramouli,"Director, Investor Relations","Good afternoon, and welcome to the Apple Q1 fiscal year 2025 earnings conference call. My name is Suhasini Chandramouli, Director of investor relations. Today's call is being recorded. Speaking first today are Apple CEO, Tim Cook; and he'll be followed by CFO, Kevan Parekh.",neutral,0.942036808,Neutral,Neutral,0,0.1,0.8,0.1,0,Neutral
Q1_2025,Timothy Donald Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"Thank you, Suhasini. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. Before I talk about our results, I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge the devastating wildfires that impacted the Los Angeles area this month. From our retail teams to Apple TV+, Apple Music, Fitness+, Beats, and more, L.A. When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, Stock Advisor’s total average return is 1,070% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 184% for the S&P 500. *Stock Advisor returns as of August 18, 2025 is home to many of our team members. Our thoughts are with everyone who is beginning the road to recovery. For our part, we are contributing to the relief efforts, and we will continue to support our teams and the local community. Now, turning to the quarter. Today, Apple is reporting revenue of $124.3 billion for the December quarter, up 4% from a year ago and an all-time record. EPS also set an all-time record of $2.40, 10% higher year over year. We achieved all-time revenue records across the majority of the countries and regions we track, including the Americas, Europe, Japan, and the rest of Asia Pacific. We also continue to see momentum in emerging markets, setting all-time revenue records in a number of markets, including Latin America, the Middle East, and South Asia, among others. English for iPhone, iPad, and Mac, and we rolled out more features and expanded to more countries in December. Now, users can discover the benefits of these new features in the things they do every day. They can use Writing Tools to help find just the right words, create fun and unique images with Image Playground and Genmoji, handle daily tasks and seek out information with a more natural and conversational Siri, create movies of their memories with a simple prompt, and touch up their photos with Clean Up. We introduce visual intelligence with camera control to help users instantly learn about their surroundings. Users can also seamlessly access ChatGPT across iOS, iPadOS, and macOS. And we were excited to recently begin our international expansion with Apple Intelligence now available in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, and the U.K. We're working hard to take Apple Intelligence even further. In April, we're bringing Apple Intelligence to more languages, including French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, Japanese, Korean, and simplified Chinese, as well as localized English to Singapore and India. And we'll continue to roll out more features in the future, including an even more capable Siri. Apple Intelligence builds on years of innovations we've made across hardware and software to transform how users experience our products. Apple Intelligence also empowers users by delivering personal context that's relevant to them. And importantly, Apple Intelligence is a breakthrough for privacy and AI with innovations like private cloud compute, which extends the industry-leading security and privacy of Apple devices into the cloud. Apple Intelligence opens up an exciting new frontier and is already elevating experiences across iPhone, iPad, and Mac. We're going to keep investing in innovation and in transformative tools that help users in their everyday lives. Let me now turn to our results for the quarter, starting with iPhone. iPhone revenue came in at $69.1 billion, reaching all-time iPhone revenue records in dozens of markets and regions. Our iPhone 16 lineup takes the smartphone experience to the next level in so many ways, and Apple intelligence is one of many reasons why customers are excited. With the A18 powered iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus, users are getting a big boost in battery life and incredible camera experiences with camera control. Our amazingly powerful iPhone 16 Pro models go even further with larger-than-ever displays and a pro camera system so advanced, it can turn moments into masterpieces. In Mac, revenue was $9 billion for the December quarter, 16% higher year over year, driven by significant excitement around the world for our latest Mac lineup. The Mac is more than just a powerful tool. It's a launch pad to enable users to bring their best ideas and boldest creations to life. And there are so many reasons to choose Mac, from the breathtaking performance of the M4 family of chips, to the groundbreaking and growing capabilities of Apple Intelligence. Every product in the Mac lineup offers something extraordinary, whether that's the super-portable MacBook Air, the powerhouse MacBook Pro, the world's best all-in-one iMac, or the small wonder that is the Mac Mini, which is not only stunningly capable but is our first carbon-neutral Mac. All of this is enabled by the unparalleled power of Apple silicon. iPad revenue was $8.1 billion, up 15% from a year ago, driven by strong interest for our latest products. We love hearing from customers who are discovering for the first time the versatility of iPad, from the ultra portable iPad Mini built from the ground up for Apple intelligence, to the powerful M4 iPad Pro in a stunningly thin and light design. iPad is there for our users whenever they need it and wherever they go, and we are pleased to see so much excitement and enthusiasm for our lineup. Wearables, home, and accessories revenue came in at $11.7 billion. With its most advanced display yet and a thinner, more comfortable design, the all-new Apple Watch Series 10 is the perfect companion to help users pursue their health and fitness goals this year. From the powerful Vitals app to more customizable activity rings, users have an ever-increasing set of innovative health tools at their fingertips in watchOS 11. Health innovation has long been a focus for us, and we're committed to continuing to advance this work because we know how much it matters to our users. We've introduced new hearing health features on AirPods Pro 2. And new sleep apnea notifications on Apple Watch are also helping users learn of a potentially serious condition that's thought to affect up to a billion people worldwide. During the quarter, we also brought Apple Vision Pro to even more countries, enabling more customers to discover the magic of spatial computing. Users are enjoying incredible immersive entertainment experiences and powerful new features and enhancements to Mac virtual display. Vision Pro is also supercharging the creative process, and the incredibly talented director, Jon M. Chu, recently shared how its extraordinary capabilities helped him bring the movie ""Wicked"" to life. Turning to services, we set an all-time revenue record of $26.3 billion for the December quarter, growing 14% from a year ago. We set all-time records in the Americas, Europe, and rest of Asia Pacific, and a December quarter record in Japan. Five years since launch, Apple TV+ continues to be home to incredible storytelling that viewers love. There's nothing quite like the anticipation that comes when a fan favorite returns, and we were thrilled to debut the second season of ""Severance"" earlier this month. We have so much in store for our subscribers this year with new shows like ""The Studio"" and ""Your Friends and Neighbors."" And we can't wait for the premiere of ""Formula 1"" starring Brad Pitt on June 27th, which will take viewers inside the sport in a truly unprecedented way. We're excited that Apple TV Plus continues to draw attention and accolades. Today, Apple TV+ productions have earned more than 2,500 nominations and 538 wins. During the quarter, we were also excited to launch a new Find My service that can help our users when they lose their luggage. For the first time, if you put an AirTag in your suitcase, you'll be able to share its location information with many major airlines so they can quickly track down your bags if they get lost. Turning to retail, our teams went above and beyond to help customers find the perfect gift throughout the holiday season. We also celebrated openings of new stores in China, Spain, and the U.S. And we were excited to announce plans to connect with even more customers this year by adding a fifth store in the UAE and bringing our online store to Saudi Arabia this summer. We can't wait to welcome customers to the first of several flagship store locations in Saudi Arabia that were opening beginning in 2026. I just had the chance to visit both countries last month, and I had a great time meeting with customers and team members. There's an incredible energy and passion for technology in these growing markets. Every day, I get deeply moving notes about the many ways our technology is enriching our users' lives. I recently got a note from a customer who put his watch on his father's wrist when he feared something was wrong with him. The watch alerted them that the father was in AFib and they were able to get him to the hospital for potentially life-saving treatment. Another user put his new watch on for the first time and within 15 minutes was notified of a low heart rate that led to a necessary pacemaker. And there are so many touching notes around the profound impact of our new hearing health feature, like a recent user who told me it had changed her life, allowing her to take part in conversations with her children and grandchildren. These are the kind of stories that remind us of how profoundly important our work is, and it drives us to innovate each and every day. At Apple, the future is full of promise and potential. We're always searching across a world of possibilities, finding those places where we can do the most good and putting all of our energy and ingenuity into making something special. With that, I'll turn it over to Kevan.",neutral,0.868479311,Neutral,Slightly Positive,0.1,0.5,0.3,0.1,0,Strong Positive
Q1_2025,Kevan Parekh,"Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to cover the results for the first quarter of our fiscal year. We are very pleased to report an all-time high for revenue, with December quarter revenue of $124.3 billion, up 4% year over year. We achieved all-time revenue records in the Americas, Europe, Japan, and rest of Asia Pacific and grew in the vast majority of markets we track. Products revenue was $98 billion, up 2% year over year, driven by growth from iPad and Mac. Thanks to our incredible customer satisfaction and strong loyalty, our install base of active devices reached an all-time high across all products and geographic segments and is now over 2.35 billion active devices. Services revenue reached an all-time record of $26.3 billion, up 14% year over year. We grew in every geographic segment and achieved all-time records in both developed and emerging markets. Company gross margin was 46.9% at the high end of our guidance range and up 70 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by favorable mix. Products gross margin was 39.3%, up 300 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by favorable mix and leverage. Services gross margin was 75%, up 100 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by mix. Operating expenses of $15.4 billion landed at the midpoint of our guidance range and up 7% year over year. This strong business performance resulted in all-time records for both net income at $36.3 billion and diluted earnings per share of $2.40, up 10% year over year. Operating cashflow is also strong at $29.9 billion, which included the impact of the $11.9 billion we paid during the quarter in connection with the state aid decision. Now, I'm going to provide some more details for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $69.1 billion, roughly flat to the prior year. We grew in the majority of markets we track and reached all-time revenue records in several developed markets, including Canada, Western Europe, and Japan, and in emerging markets like Latin America, the Middle East, and South Asia. The iPhone active install base grew to an all-time high in total in an average geographic segment. We also set an all-time record for upgraders. According to a recent survey from Kantar, during the December quarter, iPhone was a top-selling model in the U.S., urban China, India, the U.K., France, Australia, and Japan. We continue to see high levels of customer satisfaction in the U.S. at 96% as measured by 451 research. Mac generated $9 billion in revenue, up 16% year over year. We saw strength across our lineup, from the new Mac mini to the latest MacBook Air and MacBook Pro models. This incredible performance was broad-based with double-digit growth in every geographic segment. With our latest advances in Apple silicon and our fastest neural engine ever, customers are able to take advantage of the full capabilities of AI and Mac. The Mac install base reached an all-time high, and we saw a double-digit growth for both upgraders and customers new to the Mac. Additionally, customer satisfaction in the U.S. was recently measured at 94%. iPad revenue was $8.1 billion, up 15% year over year, driven by the new iPad mini and latest iPad Air. The iPad install base reached another all-time high, and over half of the customers who purchased an iPad during the quarter were new to the product. Customer satisfaction was at 96% in the U.S. based on the latest reports from 451 Research. Wearables, home, and accessories revenue was $11.7 billion, down 2% year over year. Customers are excited about the new AirPods 4 and the latest hearing health features in AirPods Pro 2. On watch, although we faced a difficult compare against the Watch Ultra 2 launch last year, the Apple Watch install base reached a new all-time high, with over half of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product. with features like writing tools, summarize, and priority notifications to enhance both their employee and customer experiences. We also see strong demand in our emerging markets. For example, Zomato, a leading food ordering and delivery company in India, has deployed thousands of Macs across their workforce to foster innovation. And Vision Pro continues to see more use cases in enterprise with Cisco's new spatial meetings, delivering a fully immersive video conferencing experience for remote collaboration and learning. Let me quickly summarize our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with $141 billion in cash and marketable securities. We repaid $1 billion in maturing debt and decreased commercial paper by $8 billion, resulting in $97 billion in total debt. Therefore, net cash at the end of the quarter was $45 billion. The color we're providing today assumes that the macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from what we're projecting today for the current quarter. As the dollar strengthens significantly, we expect foreign exchange to be a headwind and to have a negative impact on revenue of about 2.5 percentage points on a year-over-year basis. Despite that headwind, we expect our March quarter total company revenue to grow low to mid single digits year over year. We expect services revenue to grow low double digits year over year. When you remove the negative impact of the foreign exchange headwinds I described earlier, the year-over-year growth rate would be comparable to that of the December quarter. We expect gross margin to be between 46.5% and 47.5%. We expect operating expenses to be between $15.1 billion and $15.3 billion. We expect OI&E to be around negative $300 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments and our tax rate to be around 16%. Finally, today, our board of directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.25 per share of common stock payable on February 13th, 2025 to shareholders of record as of February 10, 2025. With that, let's open to call the questions.",positive,0.942900836,Strong Positive,Slightly Positive,0.1,0.5,0.3,0.1,0,Slightly Positive
Q1_2025,Suhasini Chandramouli,"Director, Investor Relations","Thank you, Kevan. We ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we have the first question, please? Operator Certainly.

Q1_2025,Erik Woodring,Analyst,"Great, guys. Thanks so much for taking my questions. You know, Tim, in your prepared remarks, you had noted that iPhone 16 models are selling better in markets where Apple Intelligence is available. And I'm just wondering if you could double-click on that comment a bit and share any other details you believe could, you know, better help us understand how Apple Intelligence is really impacting iPhone demand and/or what features you find that users are using most often already. And then, I just have a quick follow-up. Thank you.",neutral,0.825076878,Neutral,Neutral,0,0.2,0.7,0.1,0,Neutral
Q1_2025,Timothy Donald Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah, Erik. Hi, it's Tim. The -- we did see that the markets where we had rolled out Apple Intelligence that the year over year performance on the iPhone 16 family was stronger than those where Apple Intelligence was not available. In terms of the features that people are using, they're using all of the ones that I'd referenced in my opening comments, from Writing Tools to Image Playground and Genmoji, to visual intelligence and more. And so, we see all of those being used. The Clean Up is another one that is popular, and people love seeing that when demoed in the stores as well. We only had two, two and a half weeks or so during the December quarter of the second release of 18.2. And then, only had the U.K. and the other English language countries for the two and a half weeks. And so, we've got, you know, just the early indications at the moment. But we were glad --",neutral,0.639036536,Neutral,Slightly Positive,0.1,0.5,0.3,0.1,0,Slightly Positive
Q1_2025,Erik Woodring,Analyst,"OK. Thank you for that, Tim. It's helpful. And then, you know, if we just touch on China, obviously, in the news fairly frequently. If we set aside China macro, which I understand is still challenging, can you maybe talk about the headwinds that Apple faces, whether that's, you know, shifting preferences for Western technology brands in favor of domestic vendors, or is this just a function of not necessarily having Apple Intelligence available with the iPhone 16, which is, you know, not necessarily helping replacement cycles? Just maybe double-clicking on what you think and what you're hearing in China as a regard -- as it relates to the iPhone. Thanks so much.",neutral,0.84264046,Neutral,Neutral,0,0.2,0.7,0.1,0,Neutral
Q1_2025,Timothy Donald Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah, sure. If you look at our greater China revenue for the quarter, we were down 11% year over year. And over half of the decline that we experienced was driven by change in channel inventory from the beginning to the end of the quarter. And, of course, on the Apple Intelligence side, we have not rolled out in China. And as we just talked about, we did see better results in the markets that we had rolled out in than markets we hadn't rolled out in. And, of course, it's the most competitive market in the world. And so, all of those things are true. In terms of the macro situation, there was a fiscal stimulus or subsidy announced in -- very recently in January that did not affect the December quarter. There were some provincial subsidies in the December quarter, but the national program was announced, I believe, on January 20th. And it does cover the categories that we have products in from smartphones to tablets and PCs and smartwatches up to a certain maximum price point. And so, we do see fiscal stimulus occurring, and we'll be glad to talk about what that looks like on the next call.",negative,0.892857432,Strong Negative,Slightly Negative,0,0.1,0.4,0.4,0.1,Neutral

Q1_2025,Ben Reitzes,Analyst,"Hey, guys. Thanks a lot for the question. And hey, Tim, wanted to ask you who -- you knew this one was coming, but there's a perception that you're a big beneficiary of lower cost of compute. And I was wondering if you could give your worldly perspective here on the DeepSeek situation and if you are are going to -- if anything's happened that changed your views in terms of a tailwind to margins and your ability to execute even due to the potential for cost to come down due to that development and probably what was going to happen anyway.

Q1_2025,Timothy Donald Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"Sure. In general, I think innovation that drives efficiency is a good thing. And, you know, that's what you see in that model. Our tight integration of silicon and software, I think, will continue to serve us very well. As you know, we do things on the device, and we do things in the private cloud, and which mimics from an architectural point of view what happens on device. And from a capex point of view, we've always taken a very prudent and deliberate approach to our expenditure, and we continue to leverage a hybrid model, which, I think, continues to serve us well.",neutral,0.711586654,Neutral,Slightly Positive,0.1,0.5,0.3,0.1,0,Slightly Positive

Or do you feel that the -- you know, that the current lineup kind of shows where you're going?

First, it was encouraging to hear about the record for iPhone operators, which I think is something you haven't said for about a year now.

Q1_2025,Timothy Donald Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah, thank you for the question. If you look at iPhone, we did set an all-time record for upgraders, so we've never seen a higher level of upgraders before. The install base hit a new all-time high as well. And if you look at the 16 compared to the 15 from launch, which occurred, as you know, in September, so this is across now two quarters from September to the end of the December fiscal quarter, the 16 outperformed the 15.

We also -- the iPhone was the top-selling model in India for the quarter.

We do think there's going to be some FX headwinds, which we talked about, that's going to affect, you know, our revenue growth as well.

Q1_2025,Timothy Donald Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"You know, I don't want to project sales for the current quarter by region. But if you look at the channel inventory and look at iPhone in the aggregate, so on a worldwide basis, we're very comfortable with our channel inventory position. In China, my point was that our channel inventory reduced from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter, and that was over half of the reduction in the reported results. If you look -- part of the reason for that is that our sales were a bit higher than we forecasted them to be toward the end of the quarter.

Q1_2025,Samik Chatterjee,Analyst,"Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess, for the first one, if I -- I mean, you had a great quarter on Macs and iPads, both. And I'm just curious in terms of if you can help us think about the sustainability of this double-digit growth that you saw in both the product lines. And more interest also here, we are talking about Apple Intelligence sort of influencing volumes on iPhones, but any thoughts on sort of how -- what does that influence look like in terms of volumes for Macs, for example, where, I think, there's a lot of conversation around AI PCs, how you're thinking about the impact there?

Q1_2025,Timothy Donald Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah. If you look at Mac, Mac was up 16%. And on iPad, we were up 15%. The Mac was driven by a very strong uptake on our new products during the quarter and the continued success of the MacBook Air. And so, as you know, we've launched an M4-based MacBook Pro, an iMac, and a Mac Mini during the quarter. We believe we've got the best AI PC out there for running workloads. The silicon in the Mac is, and it has been for several years now, designed by us and really designed for these workloads. And so, I don't want to project at the category level for the future, but we're incredibly pleased with both the Mac and the iPad for the quarter.",positive,0.616107345,Slightly Positive,Slightly Positive,0.1,0.5,0.3,0.1,0,Strong Positive
Q1_2025,Samik Chatterjee,Analyst,And I'm going to use your earlier discussion about India as a strong emerging market to sort of ask you about the supply chain planning there in terms of how much of the supply chain planning that you're doing is more of a reflection of the growth expectations from that market relative to in terms of more diversification of the supply chain.

Q1_2025,David Vogt,Analyst,"Great. Thanks guys for taking my question. So, maybe, Tim, this is for you. I'm trying to think about your commentary around Apple Intelligence being sort of a momentum driver for the iPhone business. But when I think about your kind of framework for the March quarter and if I kind of adjust for channel inventory over the last couple of years, kind of feels like your iPhone revenue for the March quarter is going to be relatively similar to the quarter two years ago and even the quarter last year. So, how do we square kind of the momentum versus kind of the iPhone business effectively really kind of unchanged over the last couple of years? And then, second, when I think about kind of the gross margin profile of the business, you know, obviously, it's done a great job in taking gross margins up. Where do you think we sit in terms of on the services side at least where margins could go -- it looks like, you know, the 75% margin spending, incredibly successful quarter, but just trying to get a sense for where do you think this number could go over the -- you know, over the intermediate term? Thank you.",neutral,0.831759334,Neutral,Neutral,0,0.2,0.7,0.1,0,Slightly Positive
Q1_2025,Timothy Donald Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah, if you look at Apple Intelligence, what my point earlier was that markets where we had rolled out Apple Intelligence during the Q1 period performed better on a year-over-year basis than markets where we had not. And so, that gives us a, you know, positive indicator that we were pleased with. There are many compelling reasons to upgrade. And the other thing I would say that I think I mentioned earlier is that if you look at it from a launch to the end of the December quarter, and so, that goes back to September, the 16 family is outperforming the 15 family. And so, I think those are two good data points. Our next round of language rollouts will be in April. And so, it will be at the -- in our Q3 quarter.

Q1_2025,Kevan Parekh,"Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, great. Hi, David, how are you? So, on the services gross margin, I think maybe stepping back a second, you know, services business in general is -- in aggregate, is accretive to the overall company margin. And one of the things is an important reminder is we've got a very broad services portfolio. And those businesses have very different margin profiles. And so, I think one is because of the nature of those businesses and in part also because of the way we account for them. And so, one of the big factors that drives the services gross margins are relative performance of those different businesses within the portfolio. We also have the dynamic of some scale businesses like payment services, iCloud that are actually growing. And there, when we add incremental users, those end up being, you know, accretive to margins as well. And so, in general, what we saw in the December quarter was nice momentum across our entire services business that allows us to deliver, you know, that 75% margin at the services level. And I think our guidance takes into consideration, you know, what we think we're going to land from a company standpoint at 46.5 to 47.5, which, again, we think is a strong guide.",neutral,0.789747119,Neutral,Slightly Positive,0.1,0.5,0.3,0.1,0,Slightly Positive

You know, last quarter, you had 39.3%, which is very strong, similar to the year-ago period. I'm kind of curious, how much more levels do you have on the product side to improve the gross margin? Or do you think some of the more new AI-related devices, there's more upside to gross margin from here on the product hardware side?",neutral,0.619783044,Neutral,Neutral,0,0.2,0.7,0.1,0,Neutral
Q1_2025,Kevan Parekh,"Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, thanks, Krish, for the question. So, on the product side, as you mentioned, you know, we had pretty strong sequential improvement, 300 basis points for the December quarter. You know, that was really driven by -- we talked about favorable mix and leverage. As you know, in Q1, again, it's a launch quarter for many products, and so we tend to benefit from the leverage that we get from that higher volume. I would say, in general, you know, our gross margin of products is driven by a number of factors. One of them is the, you know, various product launches that we have, different products do have different margin profiles. And so, that mix does make a difference. And in particular, what we're seeing is, for example, many of our mixes across like phone, for example, we're seeing customers gravitate toward our pro products, you know, because of things like affordability that allows our customers to get, you know, into our best products, which have, you know, favorable gross margins. So, we're continuing to see that trend, you know, the impact of this in the December quarter. As well, I think we're in a favorable commodity environment from a cost standpoint. And so, you know, we're benefiting from that as well in the December quarter. And then, you know, that's going to be, as we talked about, we're going to have a foreign exchange headwind heading into the March quarter.

Q1_2025,Richard Kramer,Arete Research -- Analyst,"Thanks very much. My first question is for Tim. I'd like to ask about what might accelerate the pace of Apple Intelligence adoption. I guess, do you see this simply as a question of time, i.e., to launch more markets and languages, or increase the percentage of install base devices that can support it?

Q4_2024,Timothy Donald Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"Thank you, Suhasini. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. Today, Apple is reporting revenue of $94.9 billion, a September quarter record and up 6% from a year ago. iPhone grew in every geographic segment, marking a new September quarter revenue record for the category, and services set an all-time revenue record, up 12% year over year. When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, Stock Advisor’s total average return is 1,070% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 184% for the S&P 500. *Stock Advisor returns as of August 18, 2025 We also set September quarter segment revenue records in the Americas, Europe, and the rest of Asia Pacific as well as in a large number of countries, including the United States, Brazil, Mexico, France, the U.K., Korea, Malaysia, Thailand, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE. And we continue to be excited by the enthusiasm we're seeing in India, where we set an all-time revenue record. This has been an extraordinary year of innovation at Apple. We brought the revolutionary Apple Vision Pro to customers in February, which brings users tomorrow's technology today. And in June, we announced Apple Intelligence, a remarkable personal intelligent system that combines the power of generative models with personal context to deliver intelligence that is incredibly useful and relevant. Apple Intelligence marks the beginning of a new chapter for Apple Innovation and redefines privacy and AI by extending our groundbreaking approach to privacy into the cloud with private cloud compute. Earlier this week, we made the first set of Apple Intelligence features available in U.S. English for iPhone, iPad, and Mac users with systemwide writing tools that help you refine your writing, a more natural and conversational Siri, a more intelligent Photos app, including the ability to create movies simply by typing a description, and new ways to prioritize and stay in the moment with notification summaries and priority messages. And we look forward to additional intelligence features in December with even more powerful writing tools, a new visual intelligence experience that builds on Apple Intelligence and ChatGPT integration as well as localized English in several countries, including the U.K., Australia, and Canada. These features have already been provided to developers, and we're getting great feedback. More features will be rolling out in the coming months as well as support for more languages, and this is just the beginning. Now, I'll turn to our results for the quarter, beginning with iPhone. iPhone revenues set a September quarter record of $46.2 billion, up 6% from a year ago with growth in every geographic segment. With the introduction of Apple Intelligence, we're beginning a new era for iPhone. iPhone 16 powered by 18 is equipped with an incredible new 48-megapixel Fusion camera, fantastic photo experiences, and the addition of the action button and camera control. And iPhone 16 Pro is the most advanced iPhone we've ever made, powered by A18 Pro and featuring even larger displays, an industry-leading pro camera system with camera control, and studio-quality mics, all with a huge leap in battery life. Turning to Mac. Revenue was $7.7 billion, up 2% from a year ago. Just this week, we brought a new generation of Apple silicon to Mac, M4, M4 Pro, and M4 Max. From blazing-fast performance to Apple's most advanced neural engine yet, our latest chips can easily tackle incredibly complex workflows. And they ensure our newest Macs will be the best personal computers for AI the instant they hit stores. With the newest additions to our Mac lineup, customers can choose the Mac that's just right for them. Whether that's iMac, the world's best and most beautiful all-in-one; MacBook Air, the world's most popular laptop now with double the starting memory; MacBook Pro, the best pro notebook anywhere; or the incredible mighty new Mac mini, our first-ever carbon-neutral Mac. iPad revenue was $7 billion, 8% higher year over year. iPad is unlike any other product on the market today, and it's become an essential device in homes, schools, and businesses of all sizes. Recently, we were thrilled to introduce the newest iPad mini featuring an ultra-compact design built for Apple Intelligence with support for Apple Pencil Pro. It's been a big year for iPad. iPad Air was popular with students and teachers as they got back to school this year, while creators are pushing the boundaries of what's possible with the M4-powered iPad Pro. In Wearables, Home, and Accessories, revenue was $9 billion, down 3% from a year ago. During the quarter, we launched the all-new Apple Watch Series 10, bringing a beautiful new design and new capabilities to the world's most popular watch that make it even more powerful, intelligent, and sophisticated. It's the thinnest Apple Watch yet, making it more comfortable than ever while offering the biggest, most advanced display. watchOS 11 brings some huge new health and fitness insights to users including sleep apnea notifications, which help to alert people with a potentially serious but often undiagnosed condition. We're proud of the impact we make through our health innovations on Watch, and I'm grateful for every note I receive about the importance of watching people's lives. With AirPods 4, we've broken new ground in comfort and design with our best-ever open-ear headphones available for the first time with active noise cancellation. And we were especially pleased to unveil revolutionary end-to-end hearing health capabilities for AirPods Pro 2 with hearing protection, hearing test, and hearing aid features. These just became available in a software update this week, and we believe this will make a meaningful difference in our users' lives. I've already started getting notes from customers calling the experience life-changing. And Apple Vision Pro continues to deliver special experiences that weren't possible before, including immersive entertainment like the new short film, Submerged, which gives people a view into the unique storytelling power made possible by spatial computing. Vision Pro has more than 2,500 native spatial apps and 1.5 million compatible apps for visionOS 2 as well as applications companies are building to reimagine how they work. Vision Pro continues to inspire awe in its users, and we're just scratching the surface of what's possible. Apple TV+ productions have become fixtures at award shows earning more than 2,300 nominations and more than 500 wins today. Apple also offers a live sports experience in a league of its own with MLS Season Pass, and subscribers have been cheering on their favorite teams in the MLS Cup Playoffs. This month, we also marked 10 years of Apple Pay. There's always something magical about being able to buy groceries or pay for movie tickets seamlessly with your Apple device. Today, users choose Apple Pay for purchases across tens of millions of retailers worldwide. And we're excited to make the Apple Pay experience even better with the option to redeem rewards and access loans from credit cards, debit cards, and other lenders right at checkout. Whenever we celebrate big moments, Apple Stores are the best places to share them with customers. I had an incredible time during launch day in September alongside our team at Apple Fifth Avenue where energy and enthusiasm filled the air. And in stores all over the world, customers are eager to get a closer look at our latest innovations. We also opened two new stores during the quarter, and we can't wait to bring four new stores to customers in India. We're passionate about education and believe technology has a vital role to play in both helping teachers to inspire their students and students to learn about the world around them. In honor of World Teachers' Day, Apple was proud to share new resources for teachers to engage their students in ways that aim to make learning easy and fun. Additionally, we've expanded our education grant program into 100 new schools and communities helping with everything from access to technology to educator resources to scholarships and financial support. As we near the end of the year, we're proud of the progress we've made in our efforts to be carbon-neutral across our entire footprint by the end of the decade. As I mentioned earlier, we were thrilled to introduce our first-ever carbon-neutral Mac with the latest Mac mini. And in another milestone, customers can choose a carbon-neutral option of any Apple Watch. These achievements are amazing for all of us at Apple, and we are determined to reach our 2030 goal. At Apple, across everything we do, we manage for the long term because we're always thinking about what comes next, the next great challenge, the next innovative idea, the next big breakthrough. As we close out the year, we have the best lineup we've ever had going into the holiday season, including Apple Intelligence, which marks the start of a new chapter for our products. This is just the beginning of what we believe generative AI can do, and I couldn't be more excited for what's to come. Before I hand it over to Luca, with Luca transitioning to a new role with Apple, this will be the final time he's joining our call. So, I just wanted to take a moment to recognize his extraordinary service as Apple's CFO and to thank him for his partnership. I am deeply grateful. In his 10 years in the role, Luca has done truly exceptional work in shaping Apple as we know it today. He has helped manage Apple for the long term thoughtfully and deliberately. He has helped us enrich the lives of so many around the world, and he has been a leader that people look up to and have learned so much from. I have incredible confidence in our incoming CFO, Kevan Parekh, and we look forward to more of you meeting and working with him going forward. With that, I'll turn it over to Luca.",neutral,0.786890149,Neutral,Strong Positive,0.6,0.3,0.1,0,0,Strong Positive
Q4_2024,Luca Maestri,"Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you, Tim, for the very kind words. Serving as Apple's CFO has been a real privilege and an amazing journey, and I've greatly appreciated the support from our investors and the analyst community over the years. Kevan is exceptional, and I know you will enjoy interacting with him going forward. Let me now turn to the results for the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. We are very pleased to report a new September quarter revenue record of $94.9 billion, up 6% year over year. We grew in the vast majority of the markets we track and achieved September quarter revenue records in the Americas, Europe, and rest of Asia Pacific. Products revenue was $70 billion, up 4% year over year, driven by growth in iPhone, iPad and Mac. Our installed base of active devices reached an all-time high across all products and geographic segments, thanks to very high levels of customer satisfaction and loyalty, and a large number of customers who are new to our products. Services revenue reached an all-time record of $25 billion, up 12% year over year. We saw broad-based strength around the world, reaching all-time records in both developed and emerging markets with double-digit growth and record results across most services categories. Company gross margin was 46.2%, near the high end of our guidance range. Products gross margin was 36.3%, up 100 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by favorable mix. Services gross margin was 74%, unchanged from the prior quarter. Operating expenses of $14.3 billion were at the midpoint of the guidance range we provided at the beginning of the quarter and up 6% year over year. During the quarter, we recorded a one-time income tax charge of $10.2 billion, which relates to the impact of the reversal of the European General Court's State Aid decision. When we exclude this one-time charge, net income was $25 billion and diluted earnings per share were $1.64, up 12% year over year and a September quarter record. Operating cash flow was very strong at $26.8 billion, a new September quarter record. Let me now get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $46.2 billion, up 6% year over year and a September quarter record in total and across several markets, including the U.S., the Middle East, Korea, and South Asia. The iPhone active installed base grew to a new all-time high in total and in every geographic segment. During the September quarter, many iPhone models were among the top-selling smartphones around the world. In fact, according to a survey from Kantar, iPhone was the top-selling model in the U.S., urban China, the U.K., Australia, and Japan. We continue to see high levels of customer satisfaction for the iPhone 15 family with 451 Research recently measuring it at 98% in the U.S. Mac revenue was $7.7 billion, up 2% year over year, driven by the strength in MacBook Air. Customers have been loving the performance of Apple silicon on Mac, and we are very excited to bring the latest M4 family of chips to the lineup. The Mac installed base reached an all-time high with about half of customers in the quarter being new to Mac. And in the latest reports from 451 Research, customer satisfaction was 95% in the U.S. iPad generated $7 billion in revenue, up 8% year over year. In addition to growth in developed markets, we also saw strong performance in many emerging markets with double-digit growth in Mexico, Brazil, the Middle East, India, and South Asia. The iPad installed base reached another all-time high, and over half of the customers who purchased iPads during the quarter were new to the product. Also, customer satisfaction was recently measured at 97% in the U.S. Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue was $9 billion, down 3% year over year. Turning to enterprise. We continue to see strong demand across our products and services. NVIDIA launched its Mac as a choice program supported by AppleCare for Enterprise and Apple Professional Services with over 10,000 Macs deployed worldwide. And Novartis, a leading global pharmaceutical company, recently chose iPhone 16 as the standard mobile device for all employees. We also see continued momentum with Apple Vision Pro in the enterprise space. UC San Diego Health is the first hospital in the world to test spatial computing apps on Apple Vision Pro in clinical trials for patient surgery in the operating room. Let me now turn to our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with $157 billion in cash and marketable securities. The color we are providing today assumes that the macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. We expect our December quarter total company revenue to grow low to mid-single digits year over year. We expect services revenue to grow double digits at a rate similar to what we reported in the fiscal year 2024. We expect gross margin to be between 46% and 47%. We expect opex to be between $15.3 billion and $15.5 billion. We expect OI&E to be around negative $250 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments, and our tax rate to be around 16%. Finally, today, our board of directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.25 per share of common stock payable on November 14, 2024, to shareholders of record as of November 11, 2024. With that, let us open the call to questions.",positive,0.950822413,Strong Positive,Slightly Positive,0.2,0.5,0.2,0.1,0,Strong Positive

Q4_2024,Michael Ng,Goldman Sachs -- Analyst,"Hey. Good afternoon. I just have two. The first one is for Tim on Apple Intelligence. I was wondering if you could just expand a little bit on some of the early feedback to Apple Intelligence, both for iOS 18.1 but also the developer beta so far, and whether you would attribute Apple Intelligence to any of the strong iPhone performance that we've seen to date. Thanks.",neutral,0.855549991,Neutral,Neutral,0.1,0.2,0.5,0.1,0.1,Neutral
Q4_2024,Timothy Donald Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"Thanks, Michael. As I noted in my comments, just this week on Monday, we made the first set of Apple Intelligence features available in U.S. English for iPhone, iPad, and Mac. And this includes things like systemwide writing tools that help you refine your writing, a more natural conversational Siri, more intelligent Photos app, including the ability to create movies simply by typing a description, which is really cool, and new ways to prioritize and stay in the moment with notification summaries and priority messages. There's also email summaries and email priority. We're getting a lot of positive feedback from developers and customers. And in fact, if you just look at the first three days, which is all we have obviously from Monday, the 18.1 adoption is twice as fast as the 17.1 adoption was in the year-ago quarter. And so, there's definitely interest out there for Apple Intelligence. Carrying on in the quarter, we are looking forward to bringing even more features in December, and this will include even more powerful writing tools and visual intelligence experience that builds on Apple Intelligence and ChatGPT integration in addition to other features as well as we'll bring localized English to several countries that include the U.K., Australia, and Canada. So, it's going to be quite a software quarter between the release on Monday and the release in December. And then as we turn the corner to '25, we'll have more languages rolling out in -- starting in April as well and more features as well. And so, it's a very, very strong drumbeat, and we couldn't be more excited about it.",neutral,0.621974885,Neutral,Slightly Positive,0.3,0.5,0.2,0,0,Neutral

First, congratulations again, Luca, on the new role, and it's been a real privilege of being able to spend some time with you. A question that, I think, will overlap with your new role as well.

Q4_2024,Luca Maestri,"Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Michael. On the capex front, I mentioned before a number of times, we have a bit of a hybrid model in the way we run our data centers. In some cases, we use our own data centers. In some cases, we use third-party providers. So, our capex numbers may not be fully comparable with others. But obviously, we are rolling out these features, Apple Intelligence features already now. And so, we are making all the capacity that is needed available for these features. You will see in our 10-K the amount of capex that we've incurred during the course of fiscal '24. And we will -- in fiscal '25, we will continue to make all the investments that are necessary, and of course, the investments in AI-related capex will be made.",neutral,0.885427952,Neutral,Neutral,0.1,0.2,0.5,0.1,0.1,Neutral

Q4_2024,Erik Woodring,Analyst,"Great. Thanks so much for taking my questions. I have two as well. Tim, maybe if we start with you, I think each of the last four years, you've exited the December quarter with iPhone demand outpacing supply. As we look to this quarter in the iPhone 16 cycle, lead times are relatively short. There are no known supply shortages. And I'm just curious whether you've been able to maybe get a better read on early cycle iPhone demand this year relative to past years and if so, what you've learned about upgrade rates, switching rates, trade-ups versus trading down, and being more price sensitive. And overall, any impact that Apple Intelligence may have on iPhone 16 sales? And then I have a follow-up. Thank you.",neutral,0.812404692,Neutral,Neutral,0.1,0.2,0.5,0.1,0.1,Neutral
Q4_2024,Timothy Donald Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"There's a lot there. On Apple Intelligence, we believe it's a compelling upgrade reason. And we'll -- but we just launched it three days ago, and so what we've got now from a data point of view is the number I just referenced that 18.1 has twice the adoption rate of 17.1. So, that clearly shows a level of interest out there. In terms of exiting the December quarter with demand greater than supply, that's not my recollection that that happened for all four of the years. We clearly had cases during COVID where there were disruptions, and that's -- some spilled over. But in a more regular environment where we're not having something, a 100-year flood kind of thing, we would -- our desire is to get into balance as quickly as possible. We don't want customers having to wait for products. And so, if you look at how we've done this year, we did that very quickly on the 16, on the 16 Pro family, the Pro and the Pro Max. We've been constrained in October, but we believe that soon we'll be out of constraint. And so, that's a good sign from our point of view. Keep in mind that that's a function of supply and demand, not one side or the other. And we've been preparing for the quarter for a while. So, that's what I would say there.",neutral,0.903541863,Neutral,Slightly Positive,0.2,0.4,0.3,0.1,0,Neutral
Q4_2024,Erik Woodring,Analyst,"OK. That's really helpful. Thank you, Tim. And then, Luca, if I just turn to you, obviously, it's been a pleasure working with you, and we wish you all the best in the next role. There's plenty of debate in the market right now about input cost and commodity prices and the impact that will have on gross margins. Historically, you do guide gross margins up 50 basis points sequentially, which you just told us about for the December quarter. So, can you maybe just help us understand your view of component prices and broadly whether you still see those as tailwinds to gross margins and how sustainable that tailwind might be or whether that should become a headwind as we look forward?

Q4_2024,Luca Maestri,"Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Yes, Erik. As you know, our gross margins are a factor of many, many variables. Commodities, of course, are important. They're not the only factor. But specifically on commodities, I can tell you that both for the September quarter and what we expect for the December quarter, most commodities are going to move down in price while NAND and DRAM increased during the course of the September quarter, and we expect them to increase during the December quarter. We are very pleased with the level of gross margins that we've reported during the course of the year, the entire fiscal year of '24. They are really, for our company, record levels of gross margin and obviously guiding to 46% to 47% for the December quarter with all the new technologies that we've included in the products, with all the new features that Tim has talked about a lot of new products across the board.

Of course, we've got to a run rate of $100 billion. You look back just a few years ago, and the growth has been phenomenal. We're very pleased we've got a very diversified portfolio of services. And over the years, the amount that is recurring in nature has grown and it's growing faster than the transactional piece. We have well over 1 billion paid subscriptions on our platform right now between our own services and third-party services. That continues to grow strong double digits. So, we feel very, very good.

And if I can just follow up, if I look at the growth rates across the different geographies, there's always concern around China when it comes to iPhone demand, I feel, but the performance in September looks fairly good.

Q4_2024,Timothy Donald Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah. I'll take the China question. If you look at how we did for the quarter, we were relatively flat year over year. And a key component of that improvement relative to the year-over-year performance that we had been achieving is that there was a sequential improvement in foreign exchange, and so that helped us out. As you know, it's been a headwind that we've been reporting for a period of time. But the other parts that are -- what else is going on there is that our installed base of active devices reached an all-time high. We had the top two selling smartphones in urban China according to Kantar. The level of new customers that we have buying the products like Mac and iPad are well over 50%. Watch is over three-quarters that are new to the product. And so, there's several positive signs there. In terms of the stimulus, it's a clear focus of the team there.

Keep in mind our definition of Europe in our segment reporting includes a number of emerging markets like Turkey, where we've grown very strongly, the Middle East. Tim mentioned a number of records in Saudi, in UAE. And we also include India, where we set an all-time revenue record during the September quarter.

Are you seeing any change in behavior from a consumer perspective in terms of which -- sort of on the mix front within the iPhone series where consumer adoption is given that there's more consistency of the features when it comes to Apple Intelligence across the board?

Keep in mind that, for us, we're more focused on being best than being most, and so in some cases, not in every case, some of the services that you -- the majority of the services that you mentioned are not cross-platform.

And so, I would say we -- when we plan -- every time we plan for the upcoming year, we think about all the different areas where we can deploy our resources, and we make them available to grow the business. I think we've done very well over the long term. But our fundamental philosophy is to look after the business first.

After that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts. Before turning the call over to Tim, I would like to remind everyone that the December quarter spanned 14 weeks, while the March quarter, as usual, has 13 weeks. I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks. When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Q1_2023,Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"Thank you, Tejas. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today, we're reporting revenue of $117.2 billion for the December quarter. We set all-time revenue records in a number of markets, including Canada, Indonesia, Mexico, Spain, Turkey, and Vietnam, along with quarterly records in Brazil and India. As a result of a challenging environment, our revenue was down 5% year over year. But I'm proud of the way we have navigated circumstances, seen and unforeseen, over the past several years, and I remain incredibly confident in our team and our mission and in the work we do every day. Let me discuss the three factors that impacted our revenue performance during the quarter. The first was foreign exchange headwinds, which had a nearly 800 basis point impact. On a constant currency basis, we grew year over year and would have grown in the vast majority of the markets we track. The second factor, which we described in a November 6th update with COVID-19-related challenges, which significantly impacted the supply of iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max and lasted through most of December. Because of these constraints, we had significantly less iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max supply than we planned, causing ship times to extend far beyond what we had anticipated. As we always have, every step of the way throughout the pandemic, we continue to prioritize people and worked with our suppliers to ensure the health and safety of every worker. Production is now back where we want it to be. The third factor was a challenging macroeconomic environment as the world continues to face unprecedented circumstances from inflation, to war in Eastern Europe, to the enduring impacts of the pandemic. And we know that Apple is not immune to it. But whatever conditions we face, our approach is always the same. We are thoughtful and deliberate. We manage for the long term. We adapt quickly to circumstances outside our control while delivering with excellence in the things we can. We invest in innovation, in people, and in the positive difference we can make in the world. And we do it all to provide our customers with technology that will enrich their lives and help unlock their full creative potential. It's a wonderful thing to be a part of, and it's so rewarding for all of us at Apple when we hear how much our customers are loving what we create. Let me talk now about what we saw across our product categories. Starting with iPhone. Revenue came in at $65.8 billion for the quarter, down 8% year over year. However, on a constant currency basis, iPhone revenue was roughly flat. Our customers continue to rave about the astounding camera capabilities and unprecedented battery life and the groundbreaking suite of health and safety features. The iPhone 14 lineup pushes the limits of what users can do with a smartphone. During the quarter, Mac revenue came in at $7.7 billion, which was in line with what we had expected. We had a difficult compare because this time last year, we had the extremely successful launch of the redesigned M1 MacBook Pros. We also faced a challenging macroeconomic environment and foreign exchange headwinds. We remain confident in and focused on the long-term opportunity for Mac. Just last month, we introduced new MacBook Pro models powered by our latest developments in Apple silicon, M2 Pro, and M2 Max. These chips enable unprecedented performance and do so with less energy, which is not only good for the environment but gives the newest MacBook Pro the longest battery life ever in a Mac. We also introduced the M2-powered Mac mini, which will supercharge productivity for users of all kinds and leave them stunned by just how powerful a Mac mini can be. During the quarter, iPad revenue grew 30% to a total of $9.4 billion. The very strong growth was due in part to a favorable compare to the December quarter a year ago when we experienced significant supply constraints. Customers continue to praise our new lineup for its versatility, whether it's the new iPad Pro now powered by the M2 or the newly designed iPad 10th Generation with its stunning liquid retina display and beautiful colors. Revenue for Wearables, Home and Accessories was $13.5 billion, which was down 8% year over year driven by foreign exchange headwinds and a challenging macroeconomic environment. We remain excited about the long-term opportunity in the category. As an example, a few weeks ago, we announced the next-generation HomePod, which is an indispensable addition to the smart home. This powerful smart speaker relies on advanced computational audio to produce an incredible listening experience. We're also helping users make their homes safer with sound recognition. This feature arriving later this spring allows HomePod to send a notification directly to a user's iPhone if a smoke or carbon monoxide alarm sound is identified. We continue to hear wide praise for Apple Watch Series 8 and Apple Watch Ultra, which has set a new standard for what's possible with the wearable. From a whole host of health and safety features to incredible new capabilities for extreme athletes, there is something for everyone in these amazing products. Customers are excited about some phenomenal new features we've made available across many of our products as well. One of the highlights is emergency SOS via satellite, which launched for iPhone 14 customers in the U.S. and Canada in November and for customers in France, Germany, Ireland, and the U.K. in December. This is a feature we hope our users will never need, but it is incredibly heartening to get emails from people describing the life-saving impact our new safety features have had on them. We're always looking for new ways to empower people to create and collaborate. In December, we released Freeform, a brand-new app that lets users take their ideas wherever they want, anywhere they are, all while collaborating in real time. Freeform has already received praise from reviewers for its flexibility and simplicity as it works seamlessly across iPhone, iPad, and Mac. Today, we are very excited to announce that we've achieved a truly incredible milestone. Thanks to our deep commitment to innovation, incredible customer loyalty and satisfaction, and a large number of switchers, we now have more than 2 billion active devices as part of our growing installed base, double what it was just seven years ago. This is an incredible testament to our products and services and the strength of our ecosystem. We set an all-time revenue record of $20.8 billion in services, which was better than what we had expected. We achieved double-digit revenue growth from App Store subscriptions and set all-time revenue records across a number of categories, including cloud and payment services. All told, Apple now has more than 935 million paid subscriptions. Apple has also just begun a historic 10-year partnership with Major League Soccer. Just yesterday, we launched MLS Season Pass, which will give fans in more than 100 countries access to every live MLS regular season game as well as the playoffs and MLS Cup, all with no blackouts. And while we're providing more content to sports fans than ever before, Apple TV+ continues to showcase powerful characters and moving storytelling. We were thrilled to celebrate the holidays alongside our Apple TV+ subscribers with the hit movie Spirited. And we're delighted to see how much people are enjoying new and returning series like Shrinking, Slow Horses, and Truth Be Told. And we have some great upcoming movies in Sharper and Tetris, along with Emmy Award winner, Ted Lasso, returning this spring. During the quarter, we made some great updates to Fitness+ as well, expanding our catalog of more than 3,500 workouts and meditations to include a new kickboxing category and a new sleep theme for meditations. Our latest artist spotlight series features the music of the incomparable Beyonce, and we're excited to take a stroll with guests appearing on our fifth season of Time to Walk. And we continue to build on our decades-long commitment to helping small businesses thrive when we announced Apple Business Connect. This new tool gives business owners even more control over how billions of people see and engage with their products and services every day. Businesses of all sizes can now customize key information for users across Apple Maps, Messages, Wallet, Siri, and other apps. Meanwhile, in retail, we celebrated 25 years of the Apple online store and also opened Apple Pacific Centre in Vancouver and Apple American Dream in New Jersey. And I'm grateful to all the teams who helped our customers throughout the busy holiday season. At Apple, we spend a lot of time focused on creating an unparalleled experience for our customers and every product and service that we offer. We're also just as dedicated to leading with our values in everything we do. As part of that work, we strengthened our deep commitment to privacy and security, giving users 3 new tools to protect their most sensitive data: iMessage contact key verification, security keys for Apple ID, and advanced data protection for iCloud. At Apple, we feel a deep sense of responsibility to lead the world better than we found it. We're also a year closer to 2030, and we were ever focused on the environmental commitments we set out for the end of the decade. As an example, the latest Mac mini and MacBook Pro models all use 100% recycled aluminum in the enclosure and recycled rare earth elements in all magnets. And in a first for HomePod, we're using 100% recycled gold in the plating of multiple printed circuit boards. In honor of Black History Month, we released the Black Unity collection, including the Special Edition Apple Watch Black Unity Sport Loop, a new matching watch face, and iPhone wallpaper. Through our racial, equity, and justice initiative, we're expanding our support of 5 organizations focused on lifting up communities of color through technology. And we are committed as ever to building on our progress around inclusion and diversity. During the quarter, we also announced that since the inception of our Giving program 11 years ago, we've donated more than $880 million to humanitarian efforts, disaster relief, childhood education, and more. And over the last 16 years through our partnership with RED, Apple supported grants have helped more than 11 million people get the care and support services they need. As we look ahead in 2023, we are excited about the year to come. At Apple, we are always looking forward, always focused on the next challenge, always determined to do great things with unmatched creativity and unrivaled innovation. And that makes me more confident about the future of Apple than I have ever been. With that, I'll turn it over to Luca.",neutral,0.939394951,Neutral,Slightly Positive,0.2,0.4,0.3,0.08,0.02,Strong Positive
Q1_2023,Luca Maestri,Chief Financial Officer,"Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. As Tim mentioned, revenue for the December quarter was $117.2 billion, down 5% from last year. A number of factors had a significant impact on our results. First, we faced a very difficult foreign exchange environment, which affected our performance by nearly 800 basis points. In other words, we grew revenue on a constant currency basis. And in fact, we did so in the vast majority of markets. Second, the macroeconomic environment this past quarter markedly more challenging than 12 months ago. Third, we experienced significant supply shortages for iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max in November and through December. On the other hand, we had the positive impact of the 14th week in the quarter that Tejas just mentioned at the beginning of the call. Products revenue was $96.4 billion, down 8% from last year due to the factors I just called out. At the same time, however, our installed base of active devices grew double digits and achieved all-time records in each geographic segment and in each major product category. We're proud to now have over 2 billion active devices in our installed base. We also set records in many services categories, including all-time revenue records for cloud services, payment services and music and December quarter records for the App Store and AppleCare. Company gross margin was 43%, up 70 basis points from last quarter due to leverage and favorable mix, partially offset by foreign exchange. Products gross margin was 37%, up 240 basis points sequentially. And services gross margin was 70.8%, up 30 basis points sequentially, both due to the same factors that impacted total company gross margin. Operating expenses of $14.3 billion were significantly below the guidance range we provided at the beginning of the quarter and grew at a slower pace than in the past as we took actions to respond to the current macro environment. Net income was $30 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $1.88, and we generated very strong operating cash flow of $34 billion. Let me now get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $65.8 billion despite significant foreign exchange headwinds, supply constraints on iPhone 4 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max, and a challenging macroeconomic environment. In spite of these circumstances, we set all-time iPhone revenue records in Canada, Italy, and Spain, and saw strong growth in several emerging markets, including all-time iPhone revenue records for India and Vietnam. Importantly, this installed base of active iPhones continues to grow nicely and is at an all-time high across all geographic segments. In emerging markets, in particular, the installed base grew double digits. And we had record levels of switchers in India and in Mexico. Our customers continue to love their experience with our products, with the latest survey of U.S. consumers from 451 Research indicating customer satisfaction of 98% for the iPhone 14 family. Mac revenue was $7.7 billion, down 29% year over year and in line with our expectations. There were three key drivers for our Mac results. First, we had a challenging compare against last year's launch of the completely reimagined MacBook Pros, our first notebooks with M1 Pro and M1 Max. Second, we believe that the macro environment impacted our Mac performance. And third, we faced significant foreign exchange headwinds. At the same time, however, the installed base of active Macs reached an all-time high across all geographic segments, and we continue to see very strong upgraded activity to Apple silicon. Customer satisfaction with Mac remains very strong at 96% based on the latest survey of U.S. consumers from 451 Research. iPad revenue was $9.4 billion, up 30% year over year despite significant FX headwinds. This performance was driven by two key items. First, during the December quarter a year ago, we experienced significant supply constraints, while this year, we had enough supply to meet demand. Second, we launched our new iPad and the iPad Pro powered by the M2 chip during the quarter. The iPad installed base reached a new all-time high, thanks to incredible customer loyalty and a high number of new customers. In fact, over half of the customers who purchased iPads during the quarter were new to the product. Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue was $13.5 billion, down 8% year over year. The year-over-year decline was driven by significant FX headwinds and a challenging macroeconomic environment. However, our installed base of devices in the category set a new all-time record, thanks to the largest number of customers new to a smartwatch that we ever had in a given quarter. In fact, nearly two-thirds of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter were new to the product. Moving to services. We generated $20.8 billion in revenue, a new all-time record in total, and for many services offerings in spite of a difficult foreign exchange environment, and macroeconomic headwinds impacting certain categories such as digital advertising and mobile gaming. In constant currency, we grew services revenue double digits on top of growing 24% during the December quarter a year ago. We now have more than 935 million paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, up more than 150 million during the last 12 months alone and nearly four times what we had just five years ago. And we continue to increase the reach and improve the quality of our offerings. For instance, Apple Pay is now available to millions of merchants in nearly 70 countries and regions. And we saw a record-breaking number of purchases made using Apple Pay globally during the holiday shopping season. For example, Mars Incorporated has expanded its use of AppleCare for Enterprise to provide timely device support and assurance for iPads deployed across their manufacturing sites. Meanwhile, HCA Healthcare has leveraged Apple Financial Services to manage the annual refresh of its entire fleet of iPhones. This not only ensures that their staff stay current on the latest Apple technology, but also provides them with significant annual savings in the process. Let me now turn to our capital return program and our cash position. We returned over $25 billion to shareholders during the December quarter as our business continues to generate very strong cash flow. This included $3.8 billion in dividends and equivalents and $19 billion through open market repurchases of 133 million Apple shares. We ended the quarter with $165 billion in cash and marketable securities. We repaid $1.4 billion in maturing debt and decreased commercial paper by $8.2 billion, leaving us with total debt of $111 billion. This represents an acceleration in our underlying year-over-year business performance as the December quarter benefited from an extra week. Foreign exchange will continue to be a headwind, and we expect a negative year-over-year impact of five percentage points. For services, we expect revenue to grow year over year while continuing to face macroeconomic headwinds in areas such as digital advertising and mobile gaming. For iPhone, we expect our March quarter year-over-year revenue performance to accelerate relative to the December quarter year-over-year revenue performance. For Mac and iPad, we expect revenue for both product categories to decline double digits year over year because of challenging compares and macroeconomic headwinds. We expect gross margin to be between 43.5% and 44.5%. We expect opex to be between $13.7 billion and $13.9 billion. We expect OI&E to be around negative $100 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments, and our tax rate to be around 16%. Finally, today, our board of directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.23 per share of common stock payable on February 16, 2023, to shareholders of record as of February 13, 2023.

How do you think about your supply chain and maybe the levels of inventory or builds that you might need as we go forward to sort of insulate your business from these sort of episodic disruptions?

Q1_2023,Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"This is Tim, David. From a supply point of view, we did see disruption from early November through most of December. And from a supply chain point of view, we're now at a point where production is what we need it to be. And so the problem is behind us. In terms of going forward in the supply chain, we build our products everywhere. There are component parts coming from many different countries in the world, and the final assembly coming from three countries in the world on just iPhone. And so we continue to optimize it. We'll continue to optimize it over time and change it to continue to improve. I think when you sort of zoom out and back up from it, the last three years have been a pretty difficult time between COVID and silicon shortages and the like.

Q1_2023,Luca Maestri,Chief Financial Officer,"Shannon, yes, I mean, we've had good margin for the December quarter to start with. We reported 43%. Obviously, in December, we have the benefit of leverage because of the seasonality of the business, but we also had favorable mix across the board. Of course, foreign exchange is an issue right now. In the December quarter on a sequential basis, foreign exchange was a negative 110 basis points for us. And on a year-over-year basis, it's 300 basis points. So obviously, the FX environment has changed a lot during the last 12 months. For March, yes, we've seen a margin expansion, 43.5% to 44.5%. We're doing a lot of work around cost, of course. Mix will continue to help, both within categories and services mix as we move away from the holiday season. But we're doing a lot of work on the cost structure, and that is paying off. Foreign exchange is still a negative, about 50 basis points sequentially, but it's mitigating. The last couple of weeks, the dollar has weakened a bit. And so hopefully, as we go through the year, hopefully, things will improve.

Q1_2023,Erik Woodring,Morgan Stanley -- Analyst,"Guys, thanks for taking my questions. Maybe, Tim, first one for you. That 2 billion installed base -- device installed base figure, that's up, I believe, 200 million units year over year. That implies the strongest annual gain in new devices in your installed base basically as far back as you've provided those data points. And so I guess my two questions are: one, do you -- can you provide the installed base for the iPhone at year-end? And then two, is there anything that you see in this new cohort of users that might look different or similar to past cohorts, either by demographic or regions or monetization ramp? And then I have a follow-up. Thanks.",neutral,0.882943034,Neutral,Neutral,0.05,0.15,0.6,0.15,0.05,Slightly Positive
Q1_2023,Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"Yes. The installed base is now over 2 billion active devices, as you mentioned. And we set records across each geographic segment and major product category. And so it was a broad-based change. Two, correct one thing you said, it's up over 150 million year over year. The last report we reported to be over 1.85. And so it's 150 million, which we're very proud of. We also saw strong double-digit in several of the emerging markets, which is very important to us. For example, India and Brazil as just two examples. So very, very strong. And obviously, it bodes well for the future.",positive,0.67324549,Slightly Positive,Slightly Positive,0.2,0.4,0.3,0.08,0.02,Strong Positive
Q1_2023,Erik Woodring,Morgan Stanley -- Analyst,"Great. Thank you for that, Tim. And then, Luca, obviously, the December quarter was negatively impacted by the production challenges. Can you just maybe unpackage where channel inventory levels are today kind of across the iPhone broadly? And then what the data that you're seeing so far this quarter is telling you about iPhone demand deferral versus kind of iPhone demand structuring and perhaps pushing some upgrades later into the year rather than into the March quarter? And that's it for me.",neutral,0.74891907,Neutral,Neutral,0.05,0.15,0.6,0.15,0.05,Neutral
Q1_2023,Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"Yes. Erik, I'll take that one as well. The channel inventory levels on iPhone, we obviously ended the December quarter below our target range given the supply challenges on iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max. But as you think about this, keep in mind that a year ago, we also exited the December quarter below our target inventory range because of supply challenges in the year-ago quarter. Not related -- not the same issue, but just as a point. And so that hopefully gives you some flavor of that. In terms of what we're seeing in January, we've included in our color that Luca provided kind of our thinking. It's very hard to estimate the recapture because you have to know exactly what would have happened and how many people bought down. And it takes a while to get that -- to get those reports in during the quarter. And so we've made our best guess at it. In terms of the sizing of the constraint in Q1, what we estimate, although not with precision, is that we would -- I thought we believe iPhone would have grown during the quarter had it not been for the supply shortages. So hopefully, that provides you a little bit of color.",neutral,0.511930346,Neutral,Slightly Positive,0.15,0.35,0.4,0.08,0.02,Slightly Positive

Q1_2023,Aaron Rakers,Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst,"Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. I have two as well, if I can. I guess the first kind of question, just going back on the gross margin line. Pretty good guidance into this March quarter.

Q1_2023,Luca Maestri,Chief Financial Officer,"Yes. Of course, with our guidance, we try to capture every aspect of our cost structure. And obviously, components are a big portion of that. So definitely, that's included. And keep in mind, again, that foreign exchange -- I mentioned earlier, I think to Shannon, that the sequential negative on FX is 50 basis points versus a year ago, it's 270 basis points. Obviously, the U.S. dollar has moved a lot over the last 12 months. So obviously, we need to find offsets and more to the negative FX in order to be able to provide this kind of guidance.

Q1_2023,Aaron Rakers,Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst,"Yep. And then kind of from a strategic perspective, given kind of the things that we're seeing out in some of your peer group, I'm curious, Tim, how you think about the role of AI in your strategy as far as particularly in the services segment, whether you're not -- you see opportunities to excel monetization abilities within the paid subscriber base and whether or not AI, is it something that you're implementing a bit more strategically there?",neutral,0.873805404,Neutral,Slightly Positive,0.2,0.4,0.3,0.08,0.02,Slightly Positive

Q1_2023,Amit Daryanani,Evercore ISI -- Analyst,"Yep. Thanks for taking my question. I guess the first one I have is, Tim, I think based on your earlier comments that iPhones would have grown ex the production issue that implied that maybe it's a $7 billion or so impact that you had in December quarter from the production challenges on the high-end models. I'm sure it's tough to see what happens this time around. But I think historically, when you've had production issues or things like this happen, what has the consumer behavior being typically? Do they tend to go down toward the lower-end models and get the phone they want quickly? Or do they just defer the production? Just from a historical perspective, I think do you typically recover what's deferred out or no?",neutral,0.713126719,Neutral,Neutral,0.05,0.15,0.6,0.15,0.05,Slightly Negative
Q1_2023,Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"It's very hard to estimate is the real answer because you have to know a lot of data, and it's usually only in hindsight that you have a more reasonable view of it.

Q1_2023,Amit Daryanani,Evercore ISI -- Analyst,"All right. And then I guess maybe if I think about services as you go forward. I know you had really good growth in services, I think, over the last several years. But as you go forward in services, what do you think drives the growth more? So is it the expansion of your installed base? Or is it more going to be driven by ARPU going higher for you?

Q1_2023,Luca Maestri,Chief Financial Officer,"Amit, there's a number of things, and I've mentioned a few of them during the call. The first step is always the installed base. It's the engine for services growth. And the fact that the installed base is growing very nicely, and it's growing in a lot of emerging markets, it's growing even faster, that gives us a larger addressable pool of customers. So that's incredibly important. The second one is that we are seeing that the level of engagement of our customers already in our ecosystem continues to grow. We -- I mentioned that both transacting accounts and paid accounts grew double digits. And so that bodes very well for the future.",positive,0.625261307,Slightly Positive,Slightly Positive,0.15,0.35,0.4,0.08,0.02,Slightly Positive

Q1_2023,Harsh Kumar,Piper Sandler -- Analyst,"Yeah. Hey. Tim,I had a quick question on emerging markets. Seems like you're making a lot of strides in India. Potentially wanted to understand the kind of share you have in China and India. And relative to that, what would be your aspirational but sort of achievable share in iPhones in those territories, whether it's units or revenues?

Q1_2023,Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"And looking at the business in India, we set a quarterly revenue record and grew very strong double digits year over year. And so we feel very good about how we performed, and that was -- that's despite the headwinds that we've talked about. Taking a step back, India is hugely exciting market for us and is a major focus. We brought the online store there in 2020. We will soon bring Apple retail there. So we're putting a lot of emphasis on the market. There's been a lot done from a financing options and trade-ins to make products more affordable and give people more options to buy. And so there's a lot going on there. We are, in essence, taking what we learned in China years ago and how we scale to China and bringing that to bear. And I don't have the exact market shares in front of me, but I think you would see that from a market share point of view that we grew around the world last quarter despite -- on iPhone despite the challenges that we've had on the supply side.

Q1_2023,Harsh Kumar,Piper Sandler -- Analyst,"Understood. And for my follow-up, I had a sort of interesting theoretical question on pricing. Assuming we get the CHIPS Act passed, and there's a whole bunch of manufacturing that happens in U.S. and other territories that are potentially somewhat more expensive than the ones you might be now, have you -- has the company done any studies to gauge the elasticity of demand relative to small price increases in your products?",neutral,0.877589226,Neutral,Neutral,0.05,0.15,0.6,0.15,0.05,Neutral

Q1_2023,Luca Maestri,Chief Financial Officer,"Wamsi, it's Luca. Yes, of course, we keep track of that. It's really important for us. Over the last seven years, as we doubled the installed base, we've seen a growing engagement of our customers on the platform. That happens, first of all, by customers transacting on the platform and then moving to paid accounts. So starting to pay for some of the services. That percentage of paid accounts tends to grow over time. We've seen it in developed markets. We see it in emerging markets. And that is due to some of the reasons that I was explaining earlier, including the fact that we made it easier for our customers to get engaged on the platform. For example, we offer multiple payment methods in many countries. And we've made it easier to explore for more services because we've added a lot of services on the platform over the last seven years.

We've also seen India build out its higher-speed transmissions. And your market is -- shares tremendously underrepresented there. And it appears with the supply chain, you're looking at diversifying kind of operational risk, not specific to any country, but just overall. Now you look at potentially opening up stores and stuff. Am I right that, that's the way you look at it is it's even more prime for opportunity now than ever?

Q4_2022,Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"Thank you, Tejas. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining the call today. Over the past year, despite a range of challenges facing the world, our teams have come together in incredible ways to drive unparalleled innovation and deliver again and again for our customers.For the September quarter, we reported record revenue of $90.1 billion, which was better than we anticipated despite stronger-than-expected foreign currency headwinds. We set an all-time revenue record for Mac and September quarter records for iPhone and wearables, home, and accessories. Services notched a September quarter record as well with revenue of $19.2 billion and more than 900 million paid subscriptions. We reached another record on our installed base of active devices, thanks to a quarterly record of upgraders and double-digit growth in switchers on iPhone. Across nearly every geographic segment, we reached a new revenue record for the quarter. And we continue to perform incredibly well in emerging markets with very strong double-digit growth in India, Southeast Asia, and Latin America. I'm also happy to report that during the quarter, silicon-related supply constraints were not significant. I want to acknowledge that we are still living through unprecedented times. From war in Eastern Europe to the persistence of COVID-19, from climate disasters around the world to an increasingly difficult economic environment, a lot of people and a lot of places are struggling. Through it all, we've aimed to help our customers navigate through the challenges while giving them the tools to drive progress for themselves and their communities. At Apple, creativity and collaboration have always been at the core of who we are. That spirit of ingenuity and teamwork helped us provide our customers with incredible innovations this year and led to another yearly revenue record. In fiscal 2022, Apple achieved revenue of $394 billion, representing 8% annual growth. We set records for iPhone, Mac, wearables, home and accessories and services while growing double-digits in emerging markets and setting records in the vast majority of markets we track. Customers are loving our iPhone 14 lineup. Loaded with camera upgrades for sharper photos, Action Mode for smoother videos and new safety features like Crash Detection and Emergency SOS via Satellite, iPhone is even more indispensable to our daily lives. iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus come with a new dual-camera system, industry-leading durability, incredible power and amazing battery life. And our iPhone 14 Pro models are packed with even more groundbreaking innovations, including a new camera system as well as always-on display and the Dynamic Island, which offers a whole new way to interact with iPhone. Just yesterday, our most advanced iPad and iPad Pro ever landed in stores. With its all-screen design, advanced cameras and faster wireless connectivity, the tenth-generation iPad looks and performs better than ever. For creatives, iPad Pro, now turbocharged by the blazingly fast M2 chip, is the perfect device to make something amazing. Our Mac customers have already been raving about the power of M2 since the arrival of our newest MacBook Air and MacBook Pro this summer. Their incredible long battery life, stunningly rich display and lightning-fast speeds are a signature part of the Mac experience and helped drive an all-time record revenue for Mac during the September quarter. In wearables, home and accessories a wave of innovation spurred 10% year-over-year revenue growth during the September quarter. New features in Apple Watch Series 8, including temperature sensing capabilities, retrospective ovulation estimates and crash detection are helping to keep customers healthier and safer. And the updated Apple Watch SE is a great way for users to start their Apple Watch journey, delivering advanced features at a new low price. The biggest, brightest and boldest Apple Watch ever made, Apple Watch Ultra pushes the boundaries of what a smartwatch can do. Packed with innovations like advanced navigation tools and the new Oceanic+ app, which turns it into a dive computer, Apple Watch Ultra has something for athletes and adventures on land and sea. The second generation of AirPods Pro powered by the new H2 chip are receiving rave reviews for delivering an unmatched wireless earbud audio experience, while canceling up to twice as much noise over the previous model. There's no better place to discover the rich spatial audio capabilities of AirPods Pro than Apple Music, the largest music catalog anywhere now with more than 100 million songs. And there's no other company that fuses best-in-class hardware with cutting-edge software and services to create a truly integrated and seamless experience. With iOS 16, we're giving customers more ways to personalize their iPhones through a customizable lock screen and focus filters. New features in Messages and Mail enable users to connect and collaborate like never before. Stage Manager in iPadOS 16 and macOS Ventura, helps users stay more productive with smoother multitasking. Meanwhile, Apple TV Plus productions continue to earn accolades. At the 74th Primetime Emmy Awards in September, Apple brought home nine statues, including a second consecutive win for Best Comedy Series for Ted Lasso. And soon, we're going to give audiences an even better entertainment experience when the all-new Apple TV 4K hit stores next week. We're also bringing Fitness+ to more customers than ever by making our entire library of over 3,000 studio-style workouts and meditations available to iPhone users in 21 countries, even those without an Apple Watch. These updates are arriving just in time for a new Artist Spotlight series with workouts featuring the music of Taylor Swift and a new workout program, Yoga for Every Runner featuring and design with one of the world's top ultramarathon athletes, Scott Jurek. While Fitness+ helps subscribers stay active, Apple Card is designed with our customers' financial health in mind. For the second year in a row, Apple Card has been ranked highest in customer satisfaction for midsized credit card issuers by J.D. Power. And our users' favorite Apple Card benefit just got even better with the upcoming addition of a new high-yield savings account to help them save and grow their daily cash rewards. Turning to retail. Last month, our team members welcomed customers to the all-new Apple Jamsil in South Korea. And through today at Apple Creative Studios, we partnered with non-profits in cities around the world to help young diverse creatives pursue their passions and connect with local mentors. And our retail teams have done exceptional work, helping customers explore our latest products and features. As we approach the holiday season with our product lineup set, I'd like to share my gratitude to our retail, AppleCare, and channel teams for the work they are doing to support customers. At Apple, we're proud of the ways we are able to help customers be productive, get healthy, stay safe and unlock their creative potential. We also understand we have important responsibilities to the communities we serve. That's why we continue to invest in education, racial equity and justice and the environment. And we are making important progress toward a more inclusive and diverse workforce. Through our Community Education Initiative, we're working alongside more than 150 partners to help students around the world learn new science and technology skills. This summer, we joined with community partners to support coding academies across the United States from Code Academy in Nashville to One Summer Chicago to the Coding 5K Camp for Girls right next door in San Jose. We've also just expanded our racial equity and justice initiative into the U.K. for the first time. Alongside the South Pink Center, we're helping aspiring creators develop their own voices and position themselves for long-lasting careers. Back in the U.S., we welcomed a new class of Black, Latino, and indigenous entrepreneurs to Apple's second Impact Accelerator. This group of innovators is focused on using green technology to mitigate the effects of climate change and serve communities most affected by it. At Apple, we care deeply about protecting the planet for future generations. To that end, in support of our 2030 environmental goals, we have asked all of our suppliers to become carbon-neutral across their entire Apple-related footprint by the end of the decade. We are also providing them with resources based on what we learned achieving net-zero carbon in our own global operations. Across our entire product lineup, we also continue to source more materials through recycling while taking less from the Earth. Every iPhone 14 is made with 100% recycled rare-earth elements in all magnets, including those used in MagSafe. And in a first for Apple Watch and iPad, we're using recycled gold in the plating of multiple printed circuit boards in our newest devices. While we're working to reduce the footprint of our hardware, we're making changes to our software to be more environmentally friendly with the soon-to-be released Clean Energy charging feature for iPhone. Our 2030 goal is a reflection of our relentless focus on the future at Apple. The world continues to be unpredictable as old challenges evolve and new ones emerge. What remains constant is the ability of our teams to create great products, services and experiences while being a force for good in the world. Whatever challenges lie ahead in the new year, we're moving forward, as we always have, investing for the long-term to deliver incredible innovations for our customers like only Apple can. And now, I'll hand it over to Luca for more details on our performance.",positive,0.934159875,Strong Positive,Slightly Positive,0.3,0.5,0.15,0.03,0.02,Strong Positive
Q4_2022,Luca Maestri,Chief Financial Officer,"Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. We are very pleased to report record financial results for the September quarter that capped another record fiscal year for Apple despite a challenging and volatile macroeconomic backdrop. We reached a September quarter revenue record of $90.1 billion, up 8% year over year despite over 600 basis points of negative foreign exchange impact, with new September quarter records in the Americas, Europe, Greater China, and rest of Asia Pacific. Importantly, in constant currency, we grew nicely in each of our geographic segments, with strong double-digit growth outside the U.S. Products revenue was $71 billion, up 9% over last year despite FX headwinds and a record for the September quarter. And it was a September quarter revenue record for iPhone and wearables, home and accessories and an all-time revenue record for Mac. Overall, our installed base of active devices continue to grow nicely. It reached an all-time high for all major product categories and geographic segments at the end of the quarter, thanks to extremely strong customer satisfaction and loyalty and a high number of customers that are new to our products. Products gross margin was 34.6%, up 10 basis points sequentially, with improved leverage and favorable mix partially offset by foreign exchange. Services gross margin was 70.5%, down 100 basis points sequentially, primarily due to foreign exchange. Net income of $20.7 billion, diluted earnings per share of $1.29 and operating cash flow of $24.1 billion were all September quarter records. Let me now get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue grew 10% year over year to a September quarter record of $42.6 billion, despite significant foreign exchange headwinds. We set September quarter records in the vast majority of markets we track, and our performance was particularly impressive in several large emerging markets, with India setting a new all-time revenue record and Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, and Mexico more than doubling year over year. Thanks to our strong iPhone lineup, we set a quarterly record for upgraders and grew switchers double digits. This level of sales performance, along with unmatched customer loyalty, drove the active installed base of iPhones to a new all-time high across all geographic segments. And the latest survey of U.S. consumers from 451 Research indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 98%. It was a great quarter for Mac. We achieved an all-time revenue record of $11.5 billion, up 25% year-over-year, despite significant FX headwinds. There were three key items that helped drive this performance. First, we benefited from the launch of our new MacBook Air and MacBook Pro powered by the M2 chip. Second, we were able to satisfy pent-up demand that carried forward from the significant supply constraints we faced during the June quarter. Third, as our supply position improved, we were able to fill the channel. Importantly, our investment in the category has attracted both upgraders and customers new to Mac and helped our installed base reach an all-time high. In fact, we set a quarterly record for upgraders, while nearly half of customers buying Macs during the quarter were new to the device. iPad revenue was $7.2 billion, down 13% year over year due to significant negative foreign exchange and a challenging compare due to the launch of new iPads a year ago. Despite this, the iPad installed base reached a new all-time high, thanks to incredible customer loyalty and a high number of new customers. In fact, over half of the customers who purchased iPads during the quarter were new to the product. Wearables, home and accessories revenue was $9.7 billion, growing 10% year over year, driven by the launch of Apple Watch and new AirPods Pro. This level of safe performance along with very strong new tool rates, drove our installed base of devices in the category to a new all-time record. For instance, two-thirds of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter were new to the product. Moving to Services, as I mentioned, we set a September quarter record in aggregate and in most geographic segments, generating $19.2 billion in revenue in spite of very large foreign exchange headwinds. It is important to remember, that we achieved double-digit constant currency growth in services on top of growing 26% during the September quarter a year ago. However, certain services were impacted by macroeconomic headwinds, including foreign exchange. Digital advertising and gaming are areas where we've seen some softness. It was not only a record year for services but also for our entire company. During the past four quarters, we grew our business by 8% or $29 billion, reaching more than $394 billion of revenue. We grew diluted earnings per share by 9% and generated over $111 billion of free cash flow, up 20% year over year. It was also a strong year for our enterprise business, as we set new annual records for iPhone, iPad and Mac during fiscal 2022 and grew strong double-digits year over year as our devices and services continue to help more and more companies empower their employees and serve their customers. For instance, Ford Manufacturing employees are using iPad and iPhone to help further improve the quality of its game-changing Ford F-150 Lightning electric trucks. iPhone's powerful A-series chip and advanced camera systems, along with third-party iOS apps, are enabling Ford to automate the visual quality inspection process in real-time to help address issues before they impact customers. And Cisco expanded its Macs as a choice program and is now offering it to all its employees to help attract and retain top talent. And when given this choice, employees have chosen Macs twice as often as other options. In addition, many enterprise customers are taking advantage of the high residual value of our products and simple trade-in process to standardize the refresh cycles for their fleets of Apple devices. This allows employees to upgrade to the latest devices regularly while making it highly predictable and cost effective for the business. Let me now turn to our cash position. Our business continues to generate very strong cash flow, which enabled us to return over $29 billion to shareholders during the September quarter. This included $3.7 billion in dividends and equivalents and $25.2 billion through open market repurchases of 160 million Apple shares. We ended the quarter with $169 billion in cash and marketable securities. We repaid $2.8 billion in maturing debt and decreased commercial paper by $1 billion while issuing $5.5 billion of new debt, leaving us with total debt of $120 billion. As a result, net cash was $49 billion at the end of the quarter as we continue to make progress toward our goal of becoming net cash neutral over time. Second, on Mac, in addition to increasing FX headwinds, we have a very challenging compare against last year, which had the benefit of the launch and associated channel fill of our newly redesigned MacBook Pro with M1. Therefore, we expect Mac revenue to decline substantially year over year during the December quarter. Specifically on services, we expect to grow but to be impacted by the macroeconomic environment increasingly affecting foreign exchange, digital advertising and gaming. We expect gross margin to be between 42.5% and 43.5%. We expect opex to be between $14.7 billion and $14.9 billion. We expect OI&E to be around negative $300 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments and our tax rate to be around 16.5%. Finally, today, our board of directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.23 per share of common stock, payable on November 10, 2022, to shareholders of record as of November 7, 2022. With that, let's open the call to questions.",positive,0.957570851,Strong Positive,Slightly Positive,0.2,0.5,0.2,0.05,0.05,Strong Positive
Q4_2022,Tejas Gala,Director of Investor Relations and Corporate Finance,"Thank you, Luca. We ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we please have the first question?

Q4_2022,Shannon Cross,Credit Suisse -- Analyst,"Thank you very much. It's great to talk to you on the call again. I'm wondering, can you just talk a bit about how you're thinking about this iPhone generation? On the positive side, you've raised prices. It seems to be mixing up. On the negative side, investors are concerned about impacted demand from the higher prices, what Huawei meant to you in prior years versus what could happen now. There are just some pressures out there. So I'm curious if you can talk to what you're seeing initially in iPhone demand and how you think it will move through. With the caveat that I understand, things are pretty uncertain out there. And then I have a follow-up. Thank you.",neutral,0.830333352,Neutral,Neutral,0.05,0.1,0.7,0.1,0.05,Neutral
Q4_2022,Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"Shannon, it's Tim. Welcome back. iPhone grew 10% in the Q4 timeframe to $42.6 billion. Customer demand was strong and better than we anticipated that it would be. And keep in mind that this is on top of a fiscal year of 2021 that had iPhone revenue grow by 39%, and so it's a tough compare as well. And so we were happy with it. In terms of the new products, the 14 and the 14 Pro and Pro Max, it's still very early. But since the beginning, we've been constrained on the 14 Pro and the 14 Pro Max and we continue to be constrained today. And so we're working very hard to fulfill the demand. It's difficult to say what the mix will be until we can satisfy the demand because we're not able to determine the accurate mix until then. But we're working very hard to do that. We were really pleased with the broadness of the iPhone strength last quarter. We had three of the top four smartphones in the U.S. and the U.K., the top three in Urban China, the top six in Australia, four out of the top five in Germany and the top two in Japan. And customer satisfaction for the iPhone remains very, very strong at 98%. And so we feel very good about how we performed in Q4. And certainly, the start of this generation would suggest that we're going to be constrained for a little while on the 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max. But we're working very hard to try to remedy that.",positive,0.55364418,Slightly Positive,Slightly Positive,0.2,0.5,0.2,0.05,0.05,Strong Positive
Q4_2022,Shannon Cross,Credit Suisse -- Analyst,"Thank you. And then, Luca, can you talk a bit about gross margin puts and takes? Just how we should think about, I mean, 10 basis points of currency this coming quarter is, I don't want to say unprecedented, but maybe it is. So I know you have hedges, but how do we think about it flowing through? And then what other -- components seem to be very favorable. But what else should we throw into the mix as we look forward?",neutral,0.92116183,Neutral,Neutral,0.05,0.1,0.7,0.1,0.05,Neutral
Q4_2022,Luca Maestri,Chief Financial Officer,"Yeah. Well, let me start with gross margin in Q4 and then I'll get to Q1. It was a September quarter record for the company. We did 42.3%, and that is in spite of, as you mentioned, very significant negative FX, for example, for Q4, on a sequential basis, FX was negative 70 basis points and on a year-over-year basis it was negative 170 basis points. Essentially every currency around the world has weakened against the dollar. Now, we have guided Q1 to 42.5% to 43.5% in spite of the fact that we have, on a year-over-year basis, 330 basis points of negative exchange. Sequentially, it's 120 basis points unfavorable. So obviously, the strong dollar makes it difficult in a number of areas. Obviously, our pricing in emerging markets makes it difficult, and the translation of that revenue back into dollars is affected. But on the positive side, we are seeing commodities behave fairly favorably for us. And so we believe we can offset the negative foreign exchange that we're seeing. And I think that the guidance that we provided reflects that. It takes into account, of course, FX. It takes into account some level of inflationary pressures. But I think the outcome is, I think, is a good one.",negative,0.823749602,Slightly Negative,Neutral,0.05,0.1,0.7,0.1,0.05,Strong Positive

Q4_2022,Erik Woodring,Morgan Stanley -- Analyst,"Hey, guys. Thanks very much for taking my questions. I have two as well. Maybe if we could just start. Luca, we saw quite the divergence in iPad and Mac performance this quarter. Both were relatively constrained from a supply perspective. So maybe can you just elaborate on some of the most impacted -- important factors that contributed to kind of the divergence in performance and whether after we get through the December quarter, those can reverse or normalize? And then I have a follow-up.",neutral,0.827141881,Neutral,Neutral,0.05,0.1,0.7,0.1,0.05,Slightly Positive
Q4_2022,Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah, Erik, it's Tim. I'll take your question. If you look at the Mac, the Mac, it was the best quarter we've ever had in the history of the company. It was helped by the product launch of the MacBook Air with M2. It was helped that in the previous quarter, in the June quarter, if you remember, we lost output from the factory for a significant portion of the quarter. And so we had a backlog exiting our Q3 headed into Q4. We were able to satisfy all of that demand during Q4 and filled the channel for the Mac. And so that led to an incredible Mac quarter. If you look at iPad, iPad had sort of the opposite happening from a launch point of view. The comp from a year ago, we launched iPads in September. We launched iPads this year in October. The other point to remember is that the iPad Pro had just launched before the quarter started in the year-ago quarter so it was our first full quarter of iPad Pro. So it was an exceptionally strong iPad quarter a year ago, and the launches were really key to that performance. And so that's the reason iPad contracted during this quarter.",negative,0.955402076,Strong Negative,Neutral,0.05,0.1,0.7,0.1,0.05,Strong Positive

And then maybe, Luca, if I were just to ask you, obviously, Tejas at the beginning of the call talked about the 14-week quarter. Maybe can you just elaborate a little bit on how you think that 14-week quarter impacts different line items, whether it's products or certain segments within the product business or the services stand-alone?

Q4_2022,Ben Bollin,Cleveland Research -- Analyst,"Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for taking the question. Tim, I was hoping we could talk a little bit about services, pieces within the portfolio.

Q4_2022,Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"Yes. If you look at the price increase that you referenced, Ben, on Monday of this week, we announced a price increase on Apple Music and on Apple TV Plus and then the corresponding Apple One, that is the consolidated bundle that includes both of those. There's really two different situations here. With Music, the cost of licensing increased. And so we are paying more for music. The good thing about that is the artist will also get more money for their songs that are enjoyed on streaming. And so there's some bit of good news there, I suppose. And then on Apple TV Plus, if you look at when we first priced it, we only had a very few shows. We were at the beginning. We are very focused on originals only, and so we had four or five shows or so in the beginning and priced it quite low. We now have a lot more content and are coming out with more each and every month. And so, we've increased the price to represent the value of the service.

Q4_2022,Kyle McNealy,Jefferies -- Analyst,"Hi. Thanks very much. Just wanted to see if you could give us a sense for what drove the Wearables result and the strength there this quarter. Was it from the maybe strong iPhone attach rates or the new products that you have available that were announced this quarter, or maybe you're still getting some benefit from customers that are more willing to come into the store now and try things on versus the pandemic when that was kind of shut down?",neutral,0.654430032,Neutral,Neutral,0.05,0.1,0.7,0.1,0.05,Neutral
Q4_2022,Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"Yes. Kyle, it's Tim. If you look at Wearables, we grew 10%, which we were very happy with. If you look at the individual pieces of that, Apple Watch was a contributor. And in particular, the new lineup was a contributor, including the Apple Watch Ultra and the Apple Watch Series 8 and the SE. The Ultra is -- was supply constrained and continues to be supply constrained during this quarter thus far. And so we're working hard to satisfy the demand bearing, get those products to customers. We also announced and launched the AirPods Pro in September. And the reviews for the product have just been off the charts in terms of the noise cancellation features and the sound quality. We're getting great, great reviews from there. In terms of what played the other way, the headwinds, obviously, FX was a headwind that affected wearables, home, and accessories, just like it affected the rest of our products and services. And we also had effect from the business in Russia, obviously, or the impact there. So that's sort of the pro and the con. The other thing that I should mention is that about two-thirds of the Apple Watches that we sold were to customers that had not previously owned an Apple Watch.

Could it possibly be impacted more by FX than product, meaning the Jim Suva family has Apple One and TV Plus and all that, and we pay typically on annual, but then when we go into the store to buy new Watches and iPad, the price is adjusted more quickly. So could it be that services growth was impacted a little bit more by FX and down the road, we could see growth reaccelerate, or am I just reading too much into the FX impact that could be different from services versus product?

Q4_2022,Luca Maestri,Chief Financial Officer,"Jim, it's Luca. No. You're right. Obviously, the FX impact on our business depends on the geographic mix of the sales that we do. Of course, you know that part, and gaming on the App Store was affected. But we were very happy with what we saw in terms of the behavior of our customers with the engagement with services. And I mentioned a number of things during the prepared remarks, the fact that, obviously, that installed base is growing, that's a positive and it's a great foundation for the future. We are seeing more transacting accounts and more paid accounts, they're both growing double digits. Paid accounts are growing faster than transacting accounts, so the penetration of paid accounts is increasing. We have a great subscription business, 900 million paid subs now on the platform and growing very fast. We doubled in 3 years.

I was curious what -- if at all, if there's anything that can be done to mitigate that.",positive,0.451753736,Slightly Positive,Slightly Positive,0.2,0.4,0.3,0.08,0.02,Neutral
Q4_2022,Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"I'll let Luca talk about FX. In terms of the people piece, we're focused on taking care of our teams and offering them the best benefits and best compensation so that we can empower them to do the best work of their lives. And so that's what we're focused on in terms of our teams. In terms of inflation, there's clearly wage inflation. There's inflation related to logistics as well. If you compare it to pre-pandemic kind of levels, that has not returned to pre-pandemic levels by any means. And there's certain silicon components that are -- have inflationary pressure as well. And so that's not an all-inclusive list of where we see it, but it gives you some ingredients of where we see inflation pressure. And we've obviously taken that into consideration in the gross margin guidance that Luca gave earlier in the call.",neutral,0.841908097,Neutral,Neutral,0.1,0.2,0.5,0.15,0.05,Neutral
Q4_2022,Luca Maestri,Chief Financial Officer,"Yes. And on foreign exchange, you're right. I mean, it's obviously a very significant factor that is affecting our results, both revenue and gross margin. What do we do about situation like this, one where we have a very strong dollar? Of course, we hedge our exposures. We try to hedge them in as many places as possible around the world. For example, I think we've been probably the first company that started hedging our exposure in China several years ago. There may be a few currency, small ones, where we don't hedge because the cost is prohibitive or the market is not there. But in general, we tend to hedge because it gives us significant level of margin stability. Obviously, over time, that protection reduces because the hedges roll over and we need to buy new contracts. But that's the primary tool that we use to offset some of the FX pressure. Of course, when we launch new products, in particular, we look at the FX situation. And in some cases, for example, customers in international markets had to -- they saw some price increases when we launched the new products, which is not something that, for example, U.S. customers have seen. And that's unfortunately the situation that we're in right now with the strong dollar. So that's the way we try to deal with that. I have to say that one of the things that we've really appreciated the most during the quarter was the fact that in spite of this very strong dollar and the difficult FX environment, we have seen very strong performance in many international markets, particularly some very large emerging markets where even in reported currencies, so in U.S. dollars, we're seeing very strong double-digit growth in places like India, Indonesia, Mexico, Vietnam, many places where we've done incredibly well. And obviously, in local currency, those growth rates are even higher. It's important for us to look at how these markets perform in local currency because it really gives us a good sense for the customer response to our products, the engagement with our ecosystem and in general, the strength of the brand. And I have to say, in that respect, we feel very, very good about the progress that we're making in a lot of markets around the world.",neutral,0.796136618,Neutral,Neutral,0.1,0.2,0.5,0.15,0.05,Strong Positive
Q4_2022,Harsh Kumar,Piper Sandler -- Analyst,"Thanks, Tim and Luca. I had a follow-up. Luca, in your prepared remarks for the guidance, you mentioned that for the December quarter, you expect the performance to decelerate relative to September. So September was a year-over-year about, call it, 8%. Should I think that, that 8% number will go down on a year-over-year basis as we look at December? Maybe you could provide some color on what you're thinking.

Q4_2022,Luca Maestri,Chief Financial Officer,"What we said is that we're going to be decelerating from September, so September was 8%, so it's going to be a lower percentage than 8%. We're not providing guidance for the reasons that we've explained. There's a lot of uncertainty there. And so we see how the quarter progresses. Keep in mind the 10 points of exchange.

Q4_2022,Krish Sankar,Cowen and Company -- Analyst,"Yeah. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I had two of them. First one, either for Tim or Luca, on cash and capital allocation. Given there's some correction and valuation for some of the private and public companies, does it change your thought process on the time line to get to cash-neutral? In other words, would you be more aggressive with acquisitions, or you think holding on to more cash due to interest income becomes more attractive versus your prior investment goals?

Q4_2022,Luca Maestri,Chief Financial Officer,"In terms of cash deployment, obviously, we like to look at the capital return program over the long arc of time. And we have done, since the beginning of the program we've done over $550 billion of buyback at an average repurchase price of $47. So the program has been incredibly successful. We are still in a position where we have net cash. And we said all along, we want to get to cash-neutral at some point. Our cash generation has been very, very strong over the years, particularly last year. I think I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we did $111 billion of free cash flow. That's up 20% year over year. And so we will put that capital to use for investors.",positive,0.887863576,Strong Positive,Neutral,0.1,0.2,0.5,0.15,0.05,Slightly Positive

Speaking first today is Apple's CEO, Tim Cook; and he'll be followed by CFO, Luca Maestri. After that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts. I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks. When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Q3_2022,Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"Thank you, Tejas. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, Apple is reporting another record June quarter with revenue of $83 billion, which was better than we expected despite supply constraints, strong foreign exchange headwinds, and the impact of our business in Russia. We set June quarter records in the Americas, in Europe, and in the rest of Asia Pacific region. We also saw June quarter revenue records in both developed and emerging markets with very strong double-digit growth in Brazil, Indonesia, and Vietnam and a near doubling of revenue in India. We saw great enthusiasm for our products and services, resulting in an all-time record for our installed base of active devices. Our supply constraints were less than we anticipated at the beginning of the quarter, coming in slightly below the range we discussed during our last call. We know that this is a time of significant challenge around the world for all of us confronting new variants of COVID-19, to those experiencing a prolonged humanitarian crisis in Ukraine and everyone dealing with the consequences of an uncertain economic environment. We know that much of the world is living through uneasy times, and it is all the more reason why we are working hard to help our customers navigate the world as it is while empowering them to create the world as it can be. Turning to iPhone. We set a June quarter record for both revenue and switchers to iPhone. With its advanced performance, capability and ease of use, customers continue to find that iPhone remains the gold standard for smartphones. And they've been raving about the iPhone 13 lineup's extraordinary camera quality with features like cinematic mode and macro photography to create eye-catching content. We were also proud to celebrate the 15th anniversary of iPhone, a device that continues to change the world in profound ways with each new innovation. Last month, Apple unleashed a wave of innovation, including the completely redesigned MacBook Air and a new 13-inch MacBook Pro. Both of these systems are powered by M2, our next generation of Apple silicon for Mac. M2 delivers a faster CPU, GPU, and neural engine along with higher memory bandwidth and new capabilities like Pro Res acceleration. And it continues the tremendous pace of innovation in Apple silicon for the Mac. We continue to have supply constraints with Mac, but we're encouraged by the strong response from customers to our incredible lineup. iPad, like Mac, continued to see strong demand during the June quarter despite ongoing supply constraints. Customers and developers have been especially excited about the new features we're bringing to iPad with iPadOS 16. This update was one of the many announcements we made at a truly extraordinary WWDC, where we shared a range of new features that give customers more control of their experience than ever before. This includes the ability to edit or delete sent messages, a new way of organizing apps on iPad and Mac, and an all-new customizable lock screen on iPhone and so much more. Today, iOS 16, iPadOS 16, MacOS Ventura, and watchOS 9 are all in public beta, and we couldn't be more excited to see what our community of developers creates with them. We unveiled new innovations and accessibility such as door detection and live captions that support users with disabilities with navigation, health, communication, and more. We also announced Apple Pay Later, which gives customers more flexibility to make purchases with their Apple devices. And with our next generation of CarPlay, we're improving the driving experience with deeper integration into vehicle hardware, allowing drivers to control their music, change the temperature and monitor their fuel levels, all from a single integrated platform. In the Wearables, Home, and Accessories category, the innovation infused across our products continues to win over new customers. Apple Watch remains a great way for health-conscious customers to track their overall wellness and fitness. And we're bringing them even more data about their workouts, sleep cycles, and medications with updates soon to arrive on watchOS 9. We were also pleased to get FDA approval for a new feature that will let users with irregular heart rhythms track the time they spend in Afib. Turning to services. Customers continue to engage enthusiastically with our content across news, fitness, music, gaming, and more. Services revenue rose to $19.6 billion, a June quarter record and a 12% increase year over year, which was in line with our expectations. We're proud of how Apple TV+ productions like Severance and Black Bird have captured the popular imagination, and we're looking forward to more exceptional content developed by extraordinary creators throughout the year. In two and a half years since launch, Apple TV+ has now earned 250 wins and over 1,100 award nominations and counting. Just this month, we learned that Apple TV+ earned 52 Emmy Award nominations across 13 titles. In our last call, I mentioned Friday Night Baseball on Apple TV+, which is already delighting baseball fans. And last month, we announced a 10-year deal to present Major League soccer matches around the world, giving global soccer fans a whole new way of viewing their favorite sport. One of the best parts of WWDC was welcoming developers to Apple Park while continuing to connect with developers all over the world. This year, we had an incredible group of developers and more opportunities to learn from one another than ever before. It was a truly special experience and a reminder of the economic miracle the App Store represents. We are proud of the fact that the iOS app economy supports more than 2.2 million jobs here in the United States and many more around the world. It's been wonderful to see earnings by small developers more than double over the past two years. And as we're supporting developers, we're also doing our part to protect customers. In 2021, we prevented nearly $1.5 billion in fraudulent transactions by stopping over 1.6 million risky and vulnerable apps and app updates. Now I want to turn to retail. This quarter, we opened the doors to Apple's first store in the Hubei province in China, welcoming the community to a beautiful new space. And earlier today, we opened Apple Brompton Road, our fifth store in Central London. We also expanded today at Apple Creative Studios to reach even more young creatives from underrepresented communities to help them realize their potential and bring their best ideas to life. I'd like to take this opportunity to express my appreciation to our team members working in Apple Stores, customer care centers, and channel partner stores and to our Apple Care teams for their incredible work supporting customers wherever they are. Creating innovative products and services that enrich people's lives is our mission. Leading with our values and everything we do gives that mission purpose. That includes a commitment to the environment where we continue our aggressive pursuit of our 2030 goals. It includes our focus on diversity and inclusion, where we are committed as ever to making progress. And it includes our work to promote racial equity and justice. We recently announced that the Global Equity Innovation Hub, in partnership with Cal State Northridge, will provide new community grants to Hispanic-serving institutions to help the next generation of creators and innovators build skills and pursue high-demand careers in STEM. We also celebrated the graduation of the inaugural class of our Developer Academy in Detroit from a program designed to give students the skills they need to pursue jobs in the thriving iOS app economy. Leading with our values also means leading with a steadfast commitment to privacy and security. Last month, we announced the introduction of passkey, a next-generation credential that's intended to replace passwords. A passkey can't be phished nor can it be stolen by hackers in a data breach because the information is stored on your device and your device alone. And as part of our effort to combat targeted attacks against the highest risk targets like journalists and human rights activists, we introduced Lockdown Mode, which is designed to protect those most at risk of sophisticated digital attacks. And we're committed to doing our part to address the housing crisis across California. To date, we have deployed more than $1.3 billion to a number of initiatives, including ones that provide financial assistance to low and moderate-income first-time home buyers develop new affordable housing and help support vulnerable populations. This quarter has ultimately been a reflection of our resilience and our optimism. As we look forward, we're clear-eyed about the uncertainty in the macro environment. Yet we remain ever focused on the same vision that has guided us from the beginning. We strive every day to be a place where imagination ignites innovation like nowhere else, where good people come together to achieve great things, where customers are the center of everything we do. And we'll continue to execute on that vision as we always have, led by a focus on excellence and a desire to leave the world better than we found it. And with that, I'll turn it over to Luca.",positive,0.940774977,Strong Positive,Slightly Positive,0.2,0.4,0.3,0.08,0.02,Strong Positive
Q3_2022,Luca Maestri,Chief Financial Officer,"Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. We are very pleased to report June quarter financial results that continue to demonstrate our ability to innovate across hardware, software, and services while operating our business effectively during very challenging economic circumstances. We set a June quarter revenue record of $83 billion, up 2% year over year despite supply constraints, over 300 basis points of foreign exchange headwinds and the impact of our business in Russia. Around the world, we set new June quarter records in the Americas, in Europe, and rest of Asia Pacific. Company gross margin was 43.3%, down 40 basis points from last quarter as seasonal loss of leverage and unfavorable foreign exchange were partially offset by favorable mix. Products gross margin was 34.5%, down 190 basis points sequentially, mainly driven by seasonal loss of leverage, mix, and FX. Services gross margin was 71.5%, down 110 basis points sequentially due to a different mix and foreign exchange. Net income was $19.4 billion and diluted earnings per share were $1.20, while operating cash flow of $22.9 billion was a June quarter record. Let me now get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue grew 3% year over year to a June quarter record of $40.7 billion despite foreign exchange headwinds as customer response to our iPhone 13 family continue to be strong. We set June quarter records in both developed and emerging markets. And the iPhone active installed base reached a new all-time high across all geographies as a result of this level of sales performance combined with unmatched customer loyalty. In fact, the latest survey of U.S. consumers from 451 Research indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 98%. We also attracted a record number of switchers for the June quarter, with strong double-digit year-over-year growth. For Mac, we generated revenue of $7.4 billion despite supply constraints and negative effects. We continue to be excited about our long-term opportunity with Mac and redefining the PC experience with our relentless innovation. Our investment focus on Mac has helped drive significant growth in our installed base, which reached an all-time high during the June quarter as nearly half of the customers purchasing a Mac were new to the product. iPad revenue was $7.2 billion, down 2% year over year due to supply constraints and negative foreign exchange. Customer response to our iPad lineup continue to be strong across consumer, education, and enterprise markets around the world. And the iPad installed base reached a new all-time high, with over half of the customers during the quarter being new to the product. Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue was $8.1 billion, down 8% year over year as we faced foreign exchange headwinds, different launch timing for Home and Accessories products and supply constraints as well as the overall macroeconomic environment. Despite this, our installed base of devices in the category hit a new all-time record, thanks to very strong customer loyalty and high new tool rates. For example, Apple Watch continues to extend its reach, with over two-thirds of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product. Our transacting accounts, paid accounts, and accounts with paid subscriptions all grew double digits year over year. And paid subscriptions showed very strong growth. We now have more than 860 million paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, which is up more than 160 million during the last 12 months alone. And finally, we continue to improve the breadth and the quality of our current Services offerings, from a constant flow of new content on Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade to great new features we recently announced for iCloud and Apple Music, which we believe our customers will love. In the enterprise market, our customers are increasingly investing in Apple products as a strategy to attract and retain talent. Bank of America is providing iPhones to all of its financial advisors so they can instantly access client information and provide timely wealth management advice from anywhere. Wipro, another large global enterprise customer, is investing in MacBook Air with M1 as a competitive advantage when recruiting new graduates globally, thanks to its superior performance and lower total cost of ownership. And with the new M2 chip powering MacBook Air and the 13-inch MacBook Pro, we expect more customers to make Mac available to their entire workforce. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $179 billion in cash and marketable securities. We repaid $3 billion in maturing debt while increasing commercial paper by $4 billion, leaving us with total debt of $120 billion. As a result, net cash was nearly $60 billion at the end of the quarter. Given the continued uncertainty around the world in the near term, we are not providing revenue guidance but we are sharing some directional insights based on the assumption that the macroeconomic outlook and COVID-related impacts to our business do not worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. Overall, we believe our year-over-year revenue growth will accelerate during the September quarter compared to the June quarter despite approximately 600 basis points of negative year-over-year impact from foreign exchange. On the product side, we expect supply constraints to be lower than what we experienced during the June quarter. Specifically related to services, we expect revenue to grow but decelerate from the June quarter due to macroeconomic factors and foreign exchange. We expect gross margin to be between 41.5% and 42.5%. We expect opex to be between $12.9 billion and $13.1 billion. We expect OI&E to be around negative  impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments and our tax rate to be around 16%. Finally, today, our board of directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.23 per share of common stock, payable on August 11, 2022, to shareholders of record as of August 8, 2022. With that, let's open the call to questions.",positive,0.877538681,Strong Positive,Neutral,0.1,0.2,0.5,0.15,0.05,Strong Positive

Q3_2022,Amit Daryanani,Evercore ISI -- Analyst,"I guess two from my side. Maybe to start on the gross margin discussion, Luca. You said that implying gross margin will be down I think, 130, 140 basis points sequentially and down a bit year over year as well in September. Maybe just what other puts and takes are in. And then very specifically, can you actually just call it what the FX headwinds are embedded in the September quarter gross margin, that would be helpful.",negative,0.662444115,Slightly Negative,Neutral,0.05,0.1,0.7,0.1,0.05,Slightly Negative
Q3_2022,Luca Maestri,Chief Financial Officer,"Yes, Amit. We're guiding 41.5% to 42.5%. On a sequential basis, the decline is expected to be driven by, as you mentioned, foreign exchange but also mix, which will be partially offset by better leverage. We expect foreign exchange impact on a sequential basis to be 50 basis points. If you look at it from a year-over-year standpoint, we are in the ballpark of a year ago in spite of the fact that foreign exchange is going to be 130 basis points negative to a year ago. So clearly, foreign exchange is something that is affecting us but we think we're navigating that fairly well.",negative,0.582598269,Slightly Negative,Neutral,0.05,0.1,0.7,0.1,0.05,Slightly Negative
Q3_2022,Amit Daryanani,Evercore ISI -- Analyst,"Fair enough. And then if I could just ask Tim the question. There's a lot of macro worries and high inflation impacting consumer demand. Certainly doesn't seem to be very visible in your performance and your expectations. So I'm wondering if you talk about, are you seeing any implications from recession fears or inflation fears to your end demand? And really just related to that, variables decline was notable. Is that where you would typically see initial signs of consumer softening perhaps?",negative,0.794672191,Slightly Negative,Neutral,0.05,0.1,0.7,0.1,0.05,Neutral
Q3_2022,Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"Thanks for the question. If you -- I'm not an economist and so I'll sort of narrow my comments to what we saw in the business. And if you look at the June quarter, we do believe that we saw macroeconomic headwinds that impacted our business and our results. And so one of those is clearly the FX, which Luca has mentioned, that was over 300 basis points on year-over-year growth rates. When you look at the product categories, on iPhone, there was no obvious evidence of macroeconomic impact during the June quarter besides FX, obviously. Mac and iPad were so gated by supply that we didn't have enough product to test the demand. And Wearables, Home, and Accessories, as you mentioned and as Luca mentioned, we did see some impact there that we would attribute to a macroeconomic environment. When you then look at Services, there were some Services that were impacted, for example, like digital advertising was clearly impacted by the macroeconomic environment. And so it's a mixed bag in terms of what we believe that we saw. Overall, we are very happy with the results. And when you think about the number of challenges in the quarter, we feel really good about the growth that we put up for the quarter. Operator We'll take our next question from Harsh Kumar with Piper Sandler.",neutral,0.907696307,Neutral,Neutral,0.05,0.1,0.7,0.1,0.05,Slightly Positive
Q3_2022,Harsh Kumar,Piper Sandler -- Analyst,"Yes. First of all, congratulations. As these are tough times, you guys are putting up tremendous results so we appreciate that as investors. My question is, when I look at your services business, I see a $20 billion business on a quarterly basis. And you keep adding -- as a company, you keep adding very interesting and transformative features such as payments, something like that every year. So I'm struggling to find a good way to think about how to model the growth of this business, considering that you add innovative features. So now that it's fairly matured as a business, what would be a good way for us to think about as investors to model the Services business?

Q3_2022,Luca Maestri,Chief Financial Officer,"As I mentioned, it has reached an all-time high across every geographic segment, across every product category. And so that's very important. Then the second lever is the customer engagement. And we know that our customers are getting more and more engaged over time. Transacting accounts, paid accounts, paid subscriptions are growing, so the level of engagement continues to grow. And then as you mentioned, the breadth and the quality of the services that we offer tends to grow over time. So these are all things that tend to help us over the long term. If you go back and you look at our growth rates over a number of quarters now, they've always been very good.

Q3_2022,Harsh Kumar,Piper Sandler -- Analyst,"Luca, very helpful. And for my follow-up, valuations have come down in the last 18 months or so for things and companies and targets that you might look at.

Q3_2022,Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"We always look and we ask ourselves if it's -- how strategic it is, and we never buy just to buy or buy just for revenue purposes. But we would buy something that is strategic for us. To date, we have concentrated on smaller IP and people acquisitions. But I wouldn't rule anything out for the future, and obviously, we are constantly surveilling the market.

Q3_2022,Erik Woodring,Morgan Stanley -- Analyst,"I have two as well. Maybe Tim, if I start with you, I think there's a debate in the market that if you look back over time, there's been a three-year cadence to iPhone cycles. We're two years into your 5G iPhone evolution. You're on track to grow units in '21 and '22. That implies there could be some pressure next year as upgrade rates slow. But your comments really suggest no slowdown. You're seeing double-digit growth in customers new to iPhone. So can you just walk us through some of the various factors you believe are driving this continued iPhone strength? And then I have a follow-up.",neutral,0.805787086,Neutral,Neutral,0.05,0.1,0.7,0.1,0.05,Neutral
Q3_2022,Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"Today, the product and the innovation within the product that is driving it. And of course, the other key variables are some things that Luca mentioned earlier where the size of the installed base has been growing significantly. We also, just in this quarter, the June quarter, set a June quarter record for switchers with strong double-digit growth. And so this is fueling the additional installed base even more. And we continue to execute across some significant geographies where there's a very low penetration of iPhone. Some of those were called out in the opening remarks between Indonesia and Vietnam and India, where we did quite well, and iPhone tends to be the engine for those markets, particularly at the beginning of creating the market there for Apple products. And so we're really looking at all of these things from the installed base to the number of switchers to the geographic distribution. Of course, the most important thing for us is to maintain an incredible customer satisfaction and loyalty from the customers.

Keep in mind, we're going to see, on a year-over-year basis, 600 basis points, 6% impact from foreign exchange so that is a big element for us.

And so that was what was behind application tracking transparency and a number of other features. We're trying to empower the user to own their data and make their own choices.

Can you give us a sense, especially now that you're launching Pay Later, what steps you might be taking to improve affordability of Apple products?

Q3_2022,Luca Maestri,Chief Financial Officer,"Yes. I mean, obviously, affordability is a very important topic for us. It's been for many years. Buy now, pay later is the latest that we are doing on this front. Fundamentally, we are working on two major initiatives for affordability. One is installment plans and installment plans have become more widespread around the world, not only here in the United States but in most markets, particularly in emerging markets. Incredibly important in terms of reducing the affordability threshold. And trading programs. Trading programs are available in a number of markets. We can do better in other markets. They're incredibly important because the residual value of our products is a huge differentiator for our users. After they use our devices, they can bring them back and they retain much more value than other platforms. And therefore, it's important for us to raise that awareness. And so we will continue to expand those programs around the world. So installments and trade-ins, very, very important on affordability.

I know that there's been a couple of U.S. carriers that have talked about some of their customers having some difficulty paying bills. And you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you saw sort of the record number of switchers in the quarter. So just wanted to kind of get a sense for what you're seeing in that particular channel without naming a specific customer.

Q3_2022,David Vogt,UBS -- Analyst,"Great. And then on the Mac business, I know that you are severely supply chain constrained. But is there a way to kind of think about the impact of the market overall on the Mac business versus the supply chain? It sounds like -- I guess, it sounds like it's almost effectively 100% supply chain constrained, but we're obviously hearing, like I'm sure you guys are seeing, anecdotal evidence and some quantifiable evidence that the broader PC market is slowing. And I think about 90 days ago, you were pretty confident with the new M2 chip that you could continue to grow throughout a potential drawdown in that particular market. Do you still feel that way?

Q3_2022,Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"Yes, I wouldn't want to project into this quarter. But for last quarter, what we saw was the -- when the COVID restrictions hit in the Shanghai corridor, we lost the primary source of supply for Mac units. And that was either running at a reduced rate or down completely for the majority of the quarter. And so it was a very big impact to the Mac business. We felt good, frankly, that we were able to, by the end of the quarter, get this back to where we were down 10 points. But the negative 10 I would classify as being driven by supply. And of course, FX feeds into this as well because of the translation issues around the world. There's also some impact because of the business in Russia. But those are the three kind of reasons that I would tell you. In terms of testing the demand, you can't really test the demand unless you have the supply. And we were so far from that last quarter that we have an estimate of what we believe demand was. But it is an estimate. We recognize how the industry is doing. We think that we've got a great story with the Mac with getting M1 out and now M2 out. We have a very, very strong offering for the back-to-school season and we'll see how we do this quarter.

Q3_2022,Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"To give you a little more color on what we saw in the June quarter, we came in slightly below, from a constraint point of view, the $4 billion number that we had put, at the four to eight are the low end of that range. And the majority of that constraint last quarter was coming out of the COVID restrictions that occurred, that resulted in plant closures and plants running at less than full utilization for some amount of the quarter, in some cases, the majority of the quarter. And then the other component that is the minority part of it is the silicon shortage that has affected our results for several quarters now. If you look into the future, the silicon shortage, we're not forecasting when that will end. We think that in the aggregate, our constraint numbers for the September quarter will be less than they were in the June quarter.

Q3_2022,Wamsi Mohan,Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst,"Luca, you mentioned revenues to accelerate year over year overall in September versus your June growth rate. Would you say that it would be reasonable to assume normal quarter-on-quarter seasonality of about $7 billion or so? Or would you say there are additional puts and takes this time around that could drive upside and downside to that? I know you noted 600 bps year over year on FX as potentially one of those.

Q3_2022,Luca Maestri,Chief Financial Officer,"Yes, Wamsi, as you know, as we said earlier, we're not providing guidance because of all the uncertainty out there. But we have given a few data points. So one of them, which you've mentioned, approximately 600 basis points of negative foreign exchange. I mean, you do a rough math, it's around $5 billion. That's a big number right there that is going to affect us, that we are having some impact from the situation in Russia and that is obviously different from normal seasonality as well. Our supply constraints, as Tim just said, are going to be lower than what we've seen in the June quarter but they're still going to be there.

Q3_2022,Wamsi Mohan,Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst,"OK, Luca. And Tim, I wanted to follow up on your comment about the macro impact that you've seen on wearables. Your wearables portfolio is probably at the lowest ASP range across your product portfolio. As you're giving this guidance or directional guidance here, how much of an impact are you assuming in potentially any macro-related slowdowns across the rest of the portfolio?

Q3_2022,Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"Yes. Let me expand a little bit on Wearables, Home, and Accessories so that I clearly communicate what we saw. We saw sort of a cocktail of headwinds on Wearables, Home, and Accessories. We saw FX, which we've talked about. We saw supply constraints, which we've talked about. Of course, there was an impact from the business in Russia. But in addition to those things, which -- those things affected all the products to some degree, we also had a different launch timing for certain home and accessory products. Like in the year-ago quarter, I think, had AirTag in it. That's just one example of something that announced last year that didn't announce this -- that we didn't have a comparable announcement this year. And in -- so in addition to those four items, we believe, based on the data, that there was also a macroeconomic environment hit. And whether or not that is because they're lower ASPs versus the higher ASPs of a phone, I can't tell you that. I can just tell you that looking at the numbers, there does appear to be headwinds in addition to the four items that we can articulate and we believe those to be macroeconomic headwinds.

Q3_2022,Jim Suva,Citi -- Analyst,"OK, that makes sense. Well, then maybe I can ask Luca a question more on the gross margins. As you look ahead, the supply chain issues, expedited shipping and all of that, do you think probably the September quarter is kind of the worst of FX and all those headwinds and things? Or is there a little bit of timing delays due to your contractual purchase commitments that you do, that maybe your suppliers are looking at higher costs and you're benefiting from some lower contracts or maybe that has already caught up?

Q3_2022,Luca Maestri,Chief Financial Officer,"Jim, I would say we provide guidance for the current quarter. But if we look ahead, there's always a couple of elements in gross margin that are a bit outside of our control and we need to be mindful of that. One of them is the foreign exchange environment. That is having an impact already for the September quarter, had an impact on June. And obviously, strong dollar tends to be a headwind for us. As you know, we have a hedging program and so we mitigate that impact. But over time, those hedges roll off and so it becomes more challenging for us. We'll see what happens with foreign exchange rates over time. That is going to be a variable that we need to track. The other one that has an impact on the aggregate gross margin is our mix of products and services. As you know, they have different margin profiles for very different reasons, different businesses, even different accounting treatment at times. And so that is also something that we will need to track over time. What matters to us, I think it goes back to Tim was saying earlier, is we want to make sure that people love our products and services, and we want all of them to be equally successful in the marketplace. Certainly, as you've seen over the last year, we've had a significant expansion in gross margins in spite of very difficult economic circumstances from COVID to inflation, interest rates going up and our margins have expanded. From a commodity standpoint, I think you were asking a question around components. Commodities are behaving OK. We're seeing some price pressure on some silicon components.

Q2_2022,Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"Thank you, Tejas. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Apple is proud to report another record quarter with a March quarter revenue record of $97.3 billion, up 9% from a year ago and better than we anticipated. iPhone, Mac and Wearables, home and accessories had their best ever March quarter, and services set an all-time record on the strength of subscription growth over the past year. Before I get into details, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the humanitarian tragedy unfolding in Ukraine. We're continuing to do everything we can to support our teams in the region, and we are donating to humanitarian efforts on the ground. We've also committed to donating products to support refugees arriving here in the United States. I also want to speak to the unpredictable nature of the pandemic. We are excited to be welcoming employees back to the offices in the US and Europe. At the same time, we are monitoring COVID-related disruptions in China. Our thoughts are with all those in the path of the virus, and we remain as committed as ever to doing our part to help protect people and their communities. These times remind us that we cannot know what the future may hold. But they remind us, too, that technology infused with humanity makes a real difference in the world. And that's where our focus has remained on driving the innovations that can enrich people's lives. Throughout the quarter, Apple continued its streak of unparalleled innovation at an unmatched pace. With Apple silicon, our teams are pushing the limits of what we once thought possible, and we are seeing leaps and bounds in performance and efficiency. Last month, we announced another breakthrough with M1 Ultra, the world's most powerful chip for a personal computer. The incredible customer response to our M1-powered MAX helped propel a 15% year-over-year increase in revenue despite supply constraints. We now have our most powerful Mac lineup ever with the addition of the entirely new Mac Studio. Paired with the new studio display, a 5K resolution display equipped with its own A13 Bionic chip, this new desktop and display transform any workspace into a creative powerhouse. As we release the groundbreaking M1 Ultra, we also expanded our iPhone offerings, adding two beautiful green finishes to the iPhone 13 lineup and introducing the new 5G-enabled iPhone SE, which is great for our existing users who want a smaller iPhone and a great value for people buying an iPhone for the first time. They love how much power and performance we've injected into such an affordable device and rave about its incredible camera and its lightning-fast speeds. In the March quarter, iPhone revenue grew 5% over the previous year despite a challenging compare as we saw strong demand from our customers for the iPhone 13 family. And with the all-new iPad Air supercharged by M1, iPad brings more power and more versatility across the entire iPad lineup. For customers around the world, iPad continues to be essential for education, creativity and entertainment. That's why we're continuing to see such a strong demand for iPad even while navigating the significant supply constraint we predicted at the start of the quarter. Turning to Wearables, home and accessories. We are pleased to see these products continue to delight our users, growing 12% year over year. Customers are enthusiastically taking charge of their health with Apple Watch Series 7 and Apple Watch SE. The rich sound, beautiful colors, and compact design of HomePod mini continue to make it a hit with customers. And there's still no better companion to Apple Music than AirPods with spatial audio that transforms the way we listen, putting our customers right in the center of the music. The seamless integration of hardware, software and services is at the center of our work and philosophy at Apple. Apple Services are designed to be easy to use with expert curation that brings our users compelling content from talented developers, creators, storytellers, and artists. These principles are reflected in all of the services we've developed, which continue to generate incredible enthusiasm from our customers. Services revenue rose to $19.8 billion in the March quarter, reflecting a 17% increase from a year ago. We were especially excited to cheer on CODA as it won the Academy Award for Best Picture, making Apple TV+ the first streaming service to win in this category. We were honored to be stewards of this incredibly powerful, deeply moving film. In a little over two years, Apple TV+ shows and movies have earned over 240 awards and more than 960 nominations. From Severance to WeCrashed to Pachinko, new Apple Originals are connecting with audiences and earning praise from critics. We're also winning over sports fans with Friday Night Baseball, which debuted earlier this month, and They Call Me Magic, a four-part documentary that premiered last week tracing the life of the iconic Magic Johnson. Fitness+ is helping users channel their inner athlete with a range of workout routines for any fitness level. We recently introduced a postpartum routine designed by mothers for mothers. And with our Apple Heart and Movement Study, we are helping researchers glean new insights into cardiovascular fitness. As our products and services entertain customers and help them stay healthy, we're also working to make their lives easier. Arizona, for example, is the first state to enable its citizens to securely add their driver's license and state IDs to Apple Wallet. More states in the territory of Puerto Rico will soon follow. We've also announced plans to introduce Tap to Pay on iPhone, a simple and secure way for businesses to accept contactless payments launching across the US later this year. To meet the needs of customers wherever they are, our Apple Retail teams are constantly adapting to better serve them. We opened a new store in the United Arab Emirates this quarter at a unique waterfront location with panoramic views of the Abu Dhabi skyline. And earlier this month, we opened a new store in Korea, our third and largest store in the heart of Seoul. And across the US, we marked the return of in-person Today at Apple sessions with a special program featuring music from pop icon, Lady Gaga. I'd like to thank our team members working in Apple stores, customer care centers, channel partner stores and our Apple Care teams for bringing customers the best of Apple. As we look to the environment, we are making good progress on our commitment to achieve carbon neutrality across our products and supply chain by 2030. Through our Green Bonds program, we're investing in breakthrough technologies like low-carbon aluminum, which we will be integrating into the new iPhone SE. And we were pleased to announce recently that we've nearly doubled the number of our top suppliers who have committed to accelerating the transition to clean energy. We are also investing in renewable energy projects in communities most impacted by climate change around the world. As we do our part to protect our planet, we're also prioritizing people. As part of our long-standing commitment to inclusion and diversity, we're continuing to build a better, stronger Apple rooted in a culture where everyone belongs. Last month, we published an update on the progress we've made with inclusion and diversity at Apple. We've hired more women than ever into leadership roles. And in the US, nearly 60% of all leadership openings were filled by people from underrepresented communities in 2021. We also recently announced a $50 million Supplier Employee Development Fund that will help workers in our supply chain discover additional educational opportunities and build new skills. And through our racial equity and justice initiative, we're continuing to advance our work to support underrepresented communities and help build a more just and equitable world. Before I hand it over to Luca, I want to acknowledge the challenges we are seeing from supply chain disruptions driven by both COVID and silicon shortages to the devastation from the war in Ukraine. We are not immune to these challenges, but we have great confidence in our teams, in our products and services and in our strategy. Fundamentally, our work is about making technology that enriches people's lives and unlocks the full creative potential of humanity. And though the twists and turns of the future may be uncertain, what is certain is that we will never stop striving to be a force for good in the world in everything we do and everything we are. With that, I'll turn it over to Luca.",positive,0.902926922,Strong Positive,Slightly Positive,0.3,0.4,0.2,0.1,0,Strong Positive
Q2_2022,Luca Maestri,Chief Financial Officer,"Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to report very strong financial results for the March quarter, during which we set a revenue record of $97.3 billion, up 9% year over year. We also set new March quarter records in the Americas, in Europe and in Greater China. On the product side, revenue was $77.5 billion, up 7% over a year ago and a March quarter record. Company gross margin was 43.7%, down 10 basis points from last quarter. A seasonal loss of leverage and unfavorable foreign exchange were partially offset by favorable mix. Products gross margin was 36.4%, down 200 basis points sequentially mainly driven by seasonal loss of leverage and FX. Services gross margin was 72.6%, up 20 basis points sequentially due to a different mix. Operating cash flow of $28.2 billion, net income of $25 billion and diluted earnings per share of $1.52 were all March quarter records. These strong March quarter results capped a record first half of the fiscal year in the midst of a challenging macroeconomic environment. We generated over $220 billion in revenue, growing 10% year over year, and set all-time records for iPhone, Mac, Wearables, home and accessories and services. These record sales results drove strong double-digit growth in operating income and earnings per share. Let me now get into more detail for each of our revenue categories during the March quarter. iPhone revenue grew 5% year over year to a March quarter record of $50.6 billion despite supply constraints thanks to a continued strong customer response to our iPhone 13 family and the launch of our new iPhone SE. We set March quarter records in both developed and emerging markets, and the latest survey of US consumers from 451 Research indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 99% for the iPhone 13 family. As a result of this level of sales performance, combined with unmatched customer loyalty, the iPhone active installed base reached a new all-time high across all geographies. For Mac, revenue of $10.4 billion was a March quarter record despite supply constraints, with 15% year-over-year growth driven by strong demand for our M1-powered MacBook Pro. As Tim mentioned earlier, our continued innovation and investment in Apple silicon has clearly shown in our Mac results as the last seven quarters have been the best seven quarter ever for Mac. Our investment focus on Mac has also helped drive significant activity in our growing installed base. In fact, we had a March quarter record for upgraders, while at the same time, nearly half of the customers purchasing a Mac were new to the product. iPad revenue was $7.6 billion, down 2% year over year due to continued supply constraints. Customer response to our iPad lineup, including our new M1-powered iPad Air, remains very strong. And our installed base of iPads reached a new all-time high during the quarter with over half of the customers purchasing an iPad during the quarter being new to the product. Wearables, home and accessories set a March quarter record of $8.8 billion, up 12% year over year, and we set March quarter revenue records in both developed and emerging markets. In particular, our Wearables business has doubled in three years and is nearly the size of a Fortune 100 business as we continue to attract many customers who are new to wearables. For instance, Apple Watch continues to extend its reach with over two-thirds of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product. Turning to services. As I mentioned, we reached an all-time revenue record of $19.8 billion, up 17%, with all-time records for the App Store, Music, cloud services and AppleCare and March quarter records for video, advertising and payment services. Also, paid subscriptions continued to show very strong growth. We now have more than 825 million paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, which is up more than 165 million during the last 12 months alone. And finally, as Tim highlighted before, we continue to improve the breadth and the quality of our current service offerings while launching new services. In the enterprise market, many businesses and government organizations continue to turn to Apple for the latest technologies to deliver innovative services to customers and employees. In March, Alaska Airlines began to replace the conventional airport self-service kiosks with iPad Pros for faster passenger check-in and self bag drop. Also, last month, the Western Australia Police force completed the world's first commercial deployment of CarPlay across their entire fleet of vehicles to complement the iPhone 13s issued to each officer. This allows officers to access critical information faster on the road and enhance public safety for the community. We also unveiled the general availability of Apple Business Essentials in the US, adding a new subscription services designed to help small businesses manage every aspect of their Apple device life cycle. Let me now turn to our cash position. As we continue to generate very strong cash flow, we ended the quarter with $193 billion in cash and marketable securities. We repaid $3.8 billion in maturing debt while increasing commercial paper by $2 billion, leaving us with total debt of $120 billion. As a result, net cash was $73 billion at the end of the quarter. We returned nearly $27 billion to shareholders during the March quarter. This included $3.6 billion in dividends and equivalents and $22.9 billion through open market repurchases of 137 million Apple shares. We also retired an additional 5 million shares in the final settlement of our 18th ASR. Given the continued confidence we have in our business now and into the future, today, our board has authorized an additional $90 billion for share repurchases as we maintain our goal of getting to net cash neutral over time. We believe our year-over-year revenue performance during the June quarter will be impacted by a number of factors. Supply constraints caused by COVID-related disruptions and industrywide silicon shortages are impacting our ability to meet customer demand for our products. We expect these constraints to be in the range of $4 billion to $8 billion, which is substantially larger than what we experienced during the March quarter. The COVID-related disruptions are also having some impact on customer demand in China. With respect to foreign exchange, we expect it to be a nearly 300 basis point headwind to our year-over-year growth rate. Additionally, we paused all sales in Russia during the March quarter. This will impact our year-over-year growth rate by approximately 150 basis points. Specifically related to services, we expect to continue to grow double digits but decelerate from our March quarter performance due to some of the factors I just described. We expect gross margin to be between 42% and 43%. We expect opex to be between $12.7 billion and $12.9 billion. We expect OI&E to be around negative $100 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments, and our tax rate to be around 16%. Finally, reflecting the dividend increase I mentioned earlier, today, our board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.23 per share of common stock payable on May 12, 2022, to shareholders of record as of May 9, 2022. With that, let's open the call to questions.",negative,0.824059367,Slightly Negative,Slightly Positive,0.3,0.4,0.2,0.1,0,Neutral

Q2_2022,Katy Huberty,Morgan Stanley -- Analyst,"Yeah. Thank you. Congrats on the quarter. A couple of macro-related questions just given everything that's going on in the market. The first is on how you're thinking about consumer spending. As we see more stock market volatility, rising interest rates, inflation, what metrics are you watching either internal to your business or external at the macro level to understand whether you'll ultimately start to see some demand impact particularly on the product side of your business?

Q2_2022,Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"Katy, hi. It's Tim. We're obviously monitoring our daily sales very closely. From an inflation point of view, we are seeing inflation. It is or was evident in our gross margin last quarter and in our opex last quarter, and it is assumed in the guidance that Luca gave for this quarter as well. So we're definitely seeing some level of inflation that I think everybody is seeing.",neutral,0.489762098,Neutral,Neutral,0.1,0.2,0.5,0.1,0.1,Neutral

Q2_2022,Katy Huberty,Morgan Stanley -- Analyst,"OK. And as it relates to that, in China, how should we think about lockdowns from an impact on supply and an impact on demand?

Q2_2022,Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah. Good question. For Q2, so the quarter that we just finished, the restrictions in China had not started yet. And so, Q2, we did have supply constraints. They were significantly lower than what we had experienced during the December quarter. They were driven by industrywide silicon shortages and specifically, the issue that I talked about on previous calls with the legacy nodes. But looking ahead, we see two causes of supply constraints. One is the COVID-related disruptions, and there's the industrywide silicon shortages that will continue. We've estimated the constraints to be in the range of $4 billion to $8 billion. And if you -- these constraints are primarily centered around the Shanghai corridor. And the -- on a positive front, almost all of the affected final assembly factories have now restarted. And so, the range, the $4 billion to $8 billion range, reflects various ramps of getting back up and running. We're also encouraged that the COVID case count that's been reported in Shanghai has decreased over the last few days. And so, there's some reason for optimism there.",negative,0.926686466,Strong Negative,Slightly Positive,0.2,0.4,0.3,0.1,0,Slightly Negative

Q2_2022,Amit Daryanani,Evercore ISI -- Analyst,"Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I guess I have two as well. First of all, I was hoping you'd just touch a little bit on the geographic growth vectors that you saw. And I think Americas grew really well, 19%, 20%. But Europe and China had much more muted growth, if you may. I know your compares are fairly difficult, but I'm curious if anything you would call out in terms of spillover effect on the macro side from Russia, Ukraine, and Europe that's seeing some impact to consumer spend or even in China. Just help us understand what happened geographically there.",neutral,0.860240102,Neutral,Neutral,0.1,0.2,0.5,0.1,0.1,Neutral
Q2_2022,Luca Maestri,Chief Financial Officer,"So Amit, as you said, in the Americas, we had a very strong quarter, up 19%, very happy across the board there. Europe, again, was a really good quarter for us. We grew 5% in spite of the fact that, of course, as you know, during the month of March, we paused our sales in Russia. So we had an impact to our sales results there for a month of the quarter. But a number of European countries, particularly in Western Europe, did really, really well for us. And so, it was a very good quarter for us, pretty much in line with our expectations. Americas was better than our expectations. China was, again, a March quarter record for us. Keep in mind, and this affected every geographic segment for us, the different launch timing for the iPhone this year versus a year ago had an impact on the March quarter results because we launched the product later a year ago than we did this year. So some of the channel fill for the new products happened during the March quarter a year ago. Japan and Asia Pacific were affected by foreign exchange. Japan would have grown in line with company average in constant currency terms. Asia Pacific as well was affected by foreign exchange with the dollar appreciating against most currencies. And then, again, this difference in the launch timing for the iPhone made a difference. Keep in mind, again, the supply constraints that we had during the quarter, our results would have been obviously better without the supply constraints. Overall, we felt very good about the performance around the world.",positive,0.910292327,Strong Positive,Slightly Positive,0.2,0.4,0.3,0.1,0,Neutral
Q2_2022,Amit Daryanani,Evercore ISI -- Analyst,"Got you. If I could just follow up on the supply chain, the $4 billion to $8 billion impact that you folks talked about. Do you think this is demand that's deferred out or demand that's essentially destroyed because you have a product cycle that's going to come out at some point soon this year? How do you think about demand deferred versus demand destroyed on that front? And then is there a sense of which product categories are most impacted by this versus not?",neutral,0.764932096,Neutral,Neutral,0.1,0.2,0.5,0.1,0.1,Neutral
Q2_2022,Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"It will affect most of the product categories. And in terms of whether it's -- whether we can recapture or not, we believe that there's a percentage of it that is recapturable and a percentage of it that is likely not where somebody needs something quickly. And that ratio or that percentage is very difficult to estimate. We obviously try to do that internally in order to demand plan, but it's not something that we share.",neutral,0.863325715,Neutral,Neutral,0.1,0.2,0.5,0.1,0.1,Neutral

Q2_2022,Chris Caso,Raymond James -- Analyst,"Yeah, thank you. Good evening. I also just wanted to dig in on the supply constraints a bit. And I guess one of the things you said is that the $4 billion to $8 billion range reflects some reopening of facilities during the quarter. I know, obviously, it's tough to predict as you go forward into the second half of launch of new products. But at that point, would you expect the constraints to still be mainly on the component side and then hopefully, if things don't get worse in China, then the facilities are open and the constraints are only the component constraints as you go into the second half of the year?",neutral,0.757147908,Neutral,Neutral,0.1,0.2,0.5,0.1,0.1,Neutral

Q2_2022,Chris Caso,Raymond James -- Analyst,"For sure. For sure. As a follow-up, I wanted to also follow on some of your comments regarding inflation and how Apple is dealing with it. Obviously, component costs have been going up in many different areas. And then, specifically in the semiconductor side, costs have been going up, but perhaps for some different reasons because of the additional cost of going up to new process nodes that they're -- it's higher than it has been in the past.

Q2_2022,Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"Well, some of what you said is in the results for the last quarter that we've announced.

Q2_2022,Jim Suva,Citi -- Analyst,"Thank you. Tim, and your entire company has done a great job at navigating through all the issues in the past several years, whether it be COVID, power outages, trade wars, shipping challenges and all that. When we hopefully someday get past all of these and the supply constraints and society and turmoil hopefully across the world, do you start to reconsider the way you do the supply chain albeit just-in-time ordering and outsourcing so much of your chips? Or do you actually consider like holding more buffer inventory internally because right now, letting $4 billion to $8 billion go away, it'd be nice to have that to be able to sell. So do you consider holding more buffer inventory or maybe even doing your own chips by outsourcing your own chips to control them more?

Q2_2022,Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"Well, I'm looking forward to that day, as I know all of you are. Our supply chain is truly global. And so, the products are made everywhere, and we do a lot in the US We'll probably be doing even more here as more chips are produced here. And we continue to look at optimizing. We learn something every day and make changes. But when you back up and kind of zoom out and look to see how the supply chain has done within the environment that you eloquently talked about, I think it's been very resilient with -- the top issue we've had clearly is the silicon shortage that I think everybody is struggling with. And I think we've done a really good job of managing through the COVID piece of it. And so, -- but we are learning, and we're making some changes as we go. We don't have a tin ear. And so, to the degree that we learn something that we should change, you can bet that we're doing that. In this business, you don't want to hold a ton of inventory. And so, you want to work on cycle times and so forth to do things very quickly and take strategic inventory in places where you need to buffer for interruptions and so forth. And so, we're constantly thinking about where those places are. In today's world, it's not really possible for us to have buffer on silicon. And so, today, silicon rolls off the fab and it's into a final assembly plant very, very quickly, and we try to make that as shorter time as possible.",neutral,0.902267098,Neutral,Neutral,0.1,0.2,0.5,0.1,0.1,Neutral

We're also seeing the gross margins there settling around the sort of 72% range, and I understand there are a lot of moving pieces beneath that.

And of course, as you've seen over the last few years, we've added a lot of new services, and we plan to add new services and new features that we believe that our customers would love. And so, we think there's great -- absolute great momentum. The growth rates can change a bit, especially during COVID because we've gone through some cycles of lockdowns and then reopenings and so on. And so, sometimes, the comps can be a bit deceiving. We are looking at it from the lens of continuing to satisfy our customers, adding to the portfolio, improving the quality of the services. And that has served us very well because in the last 12 months, we've generated $75 billion of services revenue, and you've seen the margins are obviously accretive to company margin. So we feel good, we feel good about the services business. I mentioned in my prepared remarks that the growth rate for the June quarter, we expect it to be less than the 17% that we've reported in March for some of the reasons that I described. Of course, foreign exchange is an issue with the dollar being strong at this point. And of course, we paused our sales in Russia. So we need to take that into account.

I'm just kind of curious, do you think the last three quarters Apple supply chain had a better buffer inventory of semis that kind of got used up and now you're kind of more tied to whatever the true supply constraints of legacy semis is?

Q2_2022,Luca Maestri,Chief Financial Officer,"What has happened, obviously, during COVID has changed over the quarters. Recently, for example, during the March quarter, the constraints that we had were limited to silicon shortages. When we are giving out this range of $4 billion to $8 billion, it's not only silicon, but it's the restrictions in China that we're seeing right now. So they are different. There's additional constraints at this point that we are seeing because of the COVID situation.

Q2_2022,Wamsi Mohan,Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst,"Yeah. Thank you. Luca, thanks for the color around the impacts to the revenue guidance. But I was wondering if you could share, a, if you expect to grow overall revenue in the June quarter on a year-on-year basis. And just to be clear on these impacts that you gave, those are on a year-on-year basis. Can you also tell us how much FX is a headwind, if any, on a quarter-on-quarter basis and incremental Russia impact quarter-on-quarter basis and incremental supply chain impact also on a quarter-on-quarter basis? And I have a follow-up.",neutral,0.893219352,Neutral,Neutral,0.05,0.2,0.6,0.1,0.05,Neutral
Q2_2022,Luca Maestri,Chief Financial Officer,"Well, as we said, we're not guiding to a specific revenue number and -- but just to repeat what I said during the prepared remarks, we're having supply constraints that are caused by the COVID-related disruptions and by the silicon shortages, and that is what is creating the constraints. We expect them to be in the range of $4 billion to $8 billion. This is substantially larger than what we've had during the March quarter. Again, let me repeat. The COVID-related disruptions did not affect the March quarter. So you need to keep that in mind. With respect to foreign exchange, we expect it to be nearly 300 basis points headwind. It was about 200 basis points headwind during the March quarter. For Russia, we said that the impact on a year-over-year basis is approximately 150 basis points. That reflects the three months of the quarter. We paused sales in Russia at the beginning of March, so it was a partial impact on the March quarter. So obviously, on a sequential basis, it's an incremental factor to keep in mind. I would say on the positive side here is that the demand for both our products and services is solid. Tim has mentioned a number of times, the iPhone 13 family is having a really strong year. We -- when we look at top-selling smartphones around the world, we've had pretty incredible results during the March quarter. The top six models in the United States are iPhones, the top four in Japan, the top five in Australia, five of the top six in urban China and so on and so forth. So the iPhone 13 has been truly a global success. And as you know and as you can tell from our website, most of the iPad and Mac models are constrained today. They've been constrained for several quarters because the demand is very good for those products. And the services business, as you know, is growing double digits. So that's what gives us confidence for the June quarter and going forward.",neutral,0.4644683,Neutral,Slightly Positive,0.15,0.4,0.35,0.07,0.03,Slightly Positive

At the same time, you're generating a significant amount of cash flow every year. So your capital return strategy has been an extremely successful program in the past, but $90 billion is 3% of your market cap.

We're noticing that the lead times are longer for Macs now ordered today, with some available now but many not shipping until June. Just wanted to get your insight on how much of that you think is driven by the strong March results with the product launch and likely sellout conditions versus just real tightness in the supply chain.

They are a result of the combination of the COVID disruptions and the silicon shortage that we've talked about before. And when we might remedy that, I don't -- we're not really forecasting when we can be out of the silicon shortage, so that would be a difficult answer.

Q2_2022,Ben Bollin,Cleveland Research -- Analyst,"Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. The first one is on services. Luca, I was hoping you could share a little bit of perspective on maybe how much of the services contribution is purely consumer versus enterprise and how you think about the longer-term opportunity to monetize the enterprise community. And then, Tim, for you, as a follow-up. I think Jim Suva had asked a question earlier about some of your strategy. I was curious how strategy might have evolved since everything that's been going on, what changes you might have seen as of late with respect to freight and some of the geographic production footprint and any evolution that has happened as of late.

Q2_2022,Luca Maestri,Chief Financial Officer,"So Ben, on the services side, of course, the vast majority of what we do in services is to final consumers. We do understand and appreciate the fact that the enterprise is a great opportunity for us. Very recently, for example, we launched this -- a new subscription service here in the United States which we call Apple Business Essentials where essentially, we provide support to small- and medium-sized businesses in terms of 24/7 support, device management for small business owners, which we think small companies will value and appreciate.

And I would hope that the fundamental rates reset some, both -- and I'm talking about both ocean and air. And so, both of them have come under some significant inflationary pressure partly due to COVID and some other reasons as well, I would guess.

Q1_2022,Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"Thank you, Tejas, and good afternoon. Today, we are proud to announce Apple's biggest quarter ever. Through the busy holiday season, we set an all-time revenue record of nearly $124 billion, up 11% from last year and better than we had expected at the beginning of the quarter. And we are pleased to see that our active installed base of devices is now at a new record with more than 1.8 billion devices. We set all-time records for both developed and emerging markets and saw revenue growth across all of our product categories, except for iPad, which we said would be supply constrained. As expected, in the aggregate, we experienced supply constraints that were higher than the September quarter. Before I discuss our results in greater detail, I want to first acknowledge the toll that COVID continues to have on communities around the world. In many places, case counts are higher and health systems more strained than at any point throughout the pandemic. On behalf of all of us at Apple, I want to extend our deep gratitude to the scientists, doctors, nurses, and so many others on the front lines of combating COVID-19. This is our eighth quarter reporting results in the shadow of the pandemic. And while I can't say it gets any easier, I can say I'm incredibly proud of the way our teams have come together and continue to innovate on behalf of our customers. A few weeks ago, we marked the 15th anniversary of the day Steve revealed iPhone to the world. We knew that we had the beginnings of something fundamentally transformative, though none of us could have predicted the incredible and meaningful impact it would have on all of our lives. The creative spirit that made the first iPhone possible has thrived at Apple every day since. We never stop creating. We never stop innovating. You can see that spirit reflected throughout our products from the incredible performance and capability of our M1 chips to our powerful yet easily use operating systems to our unrivaled iPhone camera systems to the beauty and magic of AirPods. That's why each of our major products leads the industry in customer satisfaction for their respective category. People expect Apple to solve hard problems with easy-to-use products. And iPhone has never been more popular. During the December quarter, we set an all-time revenue record for iPhone, thanks to the strength of our incredible iPhone 13 lineup. This is the best iPhone lineup we've ever had, and the reaction from the press and our users have been off the charts. This past quarter, we also set another all-time revenue record for Mac, with customers eager to get their hands on an M1-powered MacBook Air, iMac, or MacBook Pro. We've been thrilled with the response from Pro users to the M1 Pro and M1 Max chips and to see how Apple silicon is blowing them away with its power, performance, and efficiency. Despite the constraints I mentioned earlier, our iPad lineup continues to be indispensable to tens of millions of people from teachers and students to artists and creators. Customers are eager to get their hands on our ninth generation iPad, which features a beautiful display and double the storage capacity, as well as the new iPad mini with its ultra-portable design. Wearables, Home, and Accessories, meanwhile, set an all-time revenue record. Customers are loving the Apple Watch Series 7 with its cutting-edge health and fitness tracking features. Nearly every day, I get notes from customers who share how a heart alert led to a life-saving appointment with the cardiologist. And more recently, I've been hearing from people who tell me that their Apple Watch saved their lives by calling 911 when they couldn't. As I've said, we're still in the early innings with our health work, but every day, I am encouraged by our positive impact. We are also making great advancements in audio and are seeing strong demand from customers as a result. The HomePod mini continues to earn praise for combining the intelligence of Siri with an immersive room-filling audio experience. And our customers have responded with a lot of excitement to the magic of spatial audio on AirPods, which packs the acoustics of a concert hall. As always, the deep integration of hardware, software, and services is a hallmark of everything Apple makes. It's a principle you can see at work in the introduction of SharePlay, a feature that offers a whole new way to create shared experiences by letting users watch and listen to their favorite content together on FaceTime. Among the powerful lineup are feature films like ""The Tragedy of Macbeth,"" ""CODA,"" and ""Swan Song,"" along with many gripping new series coming up, including ""Severance"" and ""The Afterparty."" Each one is a tremendous credit to all the storytellers in front of the cameras and behind them who touched audiences all over the world. Fitness+, meanwhile, continues to inspire customers to reach their health and fitness goals. We recently introduced ""Time to Run,"" an extension of our popular series ""Time to Walk,"" as well as new collections of workouts and meditations to help users make more intentional training choices. Despite the pandemic, our retail businesses saw its highest revenue in Apple's history, and we also earned our highest ever customer satisfaction scores. That is a testament to the incredible adaptability our teams have shown as we've reimagined retail experience. I also want to take a moment to thank our retail employees and AppleCare teams for the deep care you've given to our customers as they look to get the most out of our products, learn new skills, or track down the perfect gift. We have always led with our values and with compassion and care and never has that been more needed than during the pandemic. Last quarter, we celebrated 10 years of our Employee Giving program, which we started to help our employees identify and support the causes they care most deeply about. We pledged to match their contributions to organizations doing important work at every level from their local food pantry to global humanitarian nonprofits. In the last decade, this program has contributed nearly $725 million to charitable organizations. We also celebrated 15 years of Apple's partnership with a global fund on (PRODUCT)RED, supporting their life-saving work to expand healthcare services in sub-Saharan Africa for people living with HIV/AIDS. With the support of our customers, we've now raised nearly $270 million to fund prevention, testing, and counselling services for people impacted by HIV/AIDS. And in keeping with our abiding belief in and commitment to education, we also launched a new partnership with the Boys & Girls Clubs of America. This initiative will help young people across the U.S. learn to code on iPad using our Everyone Can Code Curriculum. And we are continuing to drive innovations to help combat climate change. We are already carbon neutral across our own operations, and we are working intensely to meet our 2030 goal of carbon neutrality across our supply chain and the life cycle of our products. To celebrate Black History Month, we will be releasing a special edition Apple Watch Black Unity Braided Solo Loop and a matching Unity Lights Watch face. And through our racial equity and justice initiative, we are continuing to support organizations blazing trails to a more equitable world in our economies, our classrooms, and our criminal justice system. We recognize, as ever, that it takes all of us to confront our most profound challenges. And at Apple, we are determined to do our part. That includes our own work and inclusion and diversity, which we are advancing every day. Let me close by saying that despite the uncertainty of the world, there is one thing of which I am certain: Apple will continue to end every day and in every way to deliver on the promise of technology at its best. I will now turn it over to Luca to go over our quarterly results in more detail.",positive,0.945524037,Strong Positive,Strong Positive,0.6,0.3,0.08,0.015,0.005,Strong Positive
Q1_2022,Luca Maestri,Chief Financial Officer,"Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. We are very pleased to report record financial results for the December quarter. We set an all-time revenue record of $123.9 billion, an 11% increase from a year ago. We reached new all-time records in the Americas, Europe, Greater China, and the rest of Asia-Pacific. And it was also an all-time record quarter for both products and services. On the product side, revenue was $104.4 billion, up 9% over a year ago, despite significant supply constraints. We grew in each of our product categories, except iPad, where supply constraints were particularly pronounced, and set all-time records for iPhone; Mac; and wearables, home and accessories. The strong level of sales performance, the unmatched loyalty of our customers, and the strength of our ecosystem have driven our current installed base of active devices to a new all-time record of 1.8 billion devices. Services gross margin was 72.4%, up 190 basis points sequentially, mainly due to a different mix. Net income of $34.6 billion and diluted earnings per share of $2.10, both grew more than 20% year over year and were all-time records. Operating cash flow of $47 billion was also an all-time record. Let me get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue grew 9% year over year to an all-time record of $71.6 billion despite supply constraints, thanks to a remarkable customer response to our new iPhone 13 family. We set all-time records in both developed and emerging markets, reached all-time high in the iPhone active installed base. And the latest survey of U.S. consumers from 451 Research indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 98%. For Mac, revenue of $10.9 billion was an all-time record with growth of 25% year over year, driven by strong demand for our newly redesigned MacBook Pro powered by M1, despite supply constraints. We are one year into our transition to Apple silicon. And already, the vast majority of our Mac sales are from M1-powered devices, which helped drive a record number of upgraders during the December quarter. Our momentum in this category is very impressive as the last six quarters have been the best six quarters ever for Mac. iPad generated $7.2 billion in revenue, down 14% year over year due to very significant supply constraints, but customer demand was very strong across all models. Despite the supply shortages, our installed base of iPads reached a new all-time high during the quarter, thanks to a high number of customers that are new to iPad. In fact, around half of the customers purchasing an iPad during the quarter were new to the product. wearables, home and accessories set a new all-time record of $14.7 billion, up 13% year over year. And we set all-time revenue records in each geographic segment. We also continue to improve and expand our product offerings in this category to create unique experiences showcasing our deep integration of hardware, software, and services. In addition to an outstanding level of sales performance globally, Apple Watch continues to extend its reach, with over two-thirds of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product. Turning to services. The number of paid accounts on our digital content stores grew double digits and reached a new all-time high during the December quarter in every geographic segment. Also, paid subscriptions continue to show very strong growth. We now have more than 785 million paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, which is up 165 million during the last 12 months alone. And finally, we're adding new services that we think our customers will love, and we continue to improve the breadth and quality of our current service offerings. Just in this last quarter, we have added incredible new content on Apple TV+, on Fitness+ and Apple Arcade and a brand-new way to listen to music with Apple Music Voice. We also announced in November the beta program for Apple Business Essentials, a new service offering that brings together device management 24/7 support and iCloud storage to our small businesses, manage the end-to-end life cycle of their employees' Apple devices. We are very excited that many thousands of small business customers are already actively participating in the beta program. This announcement is just one of many ways we are expanding our support for enterprise and business customers. With the latest Macbook Pros that we've introduced last October, the new M1-powered Mac lineup has quickly become the preferred choice of Max among enterprise customers. Shopify, for example, is upgrading its entire global workforce to M1-powered MacBook Pro and MacBook Air. By standardizing on M1 Max, Shopify continues its commitment to providing the best tools to help its employees work productively and securely from anywhere. And Deloitte Consulting is expanding the deployment of the Mac Employee Choice program, including offering the new M1 MacBook Pro to empower their professionals to choose devices that work best for them in delivering consulting services. Let me now turn to our cash position. Due to our strong operating performance and holiday quarter seasonality, we ended the quarter with $203 billion in cash, plus marketable securities. We decreased commercial paper by $1 billion, leaving us with total debt of $123 billion. As a result, net cash was $80 billion at the end of the quarter. Given the continued uncertainty around the world in the near term, we are not providing revenue guidance, but we are sharing some directional insights based on the assumption that the COVID-related impacts to our business do not worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. We expect to achieve solid year-over-year revenue growth and set a March quarter revenue record despite significant supply constraints, which we estimate to be less than what we experienced during the December quarter. We expect our revenue growth rate to decelerate from the December quarter, primarily due to two factors. First, during the March quarter a year ago, we grew revenue by 54%. Remember that last year, we launched our new iPhones during the December quarter. While this year, we launched them during the September quarter. Due to the later launch a year ago, some of the associated channel inventory fill occurred during the March quarter last year. As a result of the different launch timing, we will face a more challenging year-over-year compare. Second, we expect foreign exchange to be a 3-point headwind when compared to the December quarter growth rate. We currently expect FX to have a negative impact on growth of 2 points in the March quarter, while it represented a 1-point benefit during the December quarter. Specifically related to services, we expect to grow strong double digits but decelerate from the December quarter performance. This is due to a more challenging compare because a higher level of lockdowns around the world last year led to increased usage of digital content and services. We expect gross margin to be between 42.5% and 43.5%. We expect opex to be between $12.5 billion and $12.7 billion. We expect OI&E to be around negative $150 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments, and our tax rate to be around 16%. Finally, today, our board of directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.22 per share of common stock payable on February 10, 2022, to shareholders of record as of February 7, 2022.

And can you share any thoughts across how the Pro and Pro Max mix compared to prior cycles? And on the services side, if I could just ask that, too. When you look at the gross margins there, that's been really impressive. Can you give us some sense of where within services you're seeing particularly favorable mix trends?

You did almost $11 billion this quarter, and you're still working through the M1 transition. So can you talk about where you see the opportunity to gain share? What are really sort of the target markets that you think you can go after, you know, in order to grow this beyond, I think it was about $37 billion in the last 12 months? Thank you.

Q1_2022,Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah. Shannon, thank you for the question. Mac set an all-time revenue record at $10.9 billion for the quarter. That was up 25%. And as you point out, the last six quarters for the Mac have been the top six revenue quarters of all time. And what's further very good about this is, we set all-time revenue records in Americas, in Europe, and the rest of Asia Pacific. And we set a December quarter record in Greater China. And so it's not narrowed to a particular geographic area that we're doing well in. It's almost -- about almost across the board. The response is very much because of M1. And we got even more response with the MacBook Pro that we launched in the -- during the Q1 time frame. The -- both the upgraders, which we had a record number of upgraders for the December quarter, but also in markets like China, six out of the -- six out of 10 sales are people new to the Mac. And so it's powered by both upgraders and switchers. Customer satisfaction is off the charts.

Q1_2022,Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"Katy, if you sort of step back and look at how we've done, our largest issue by far has been the chip shortage. That is industrywide and on these legacy nodes, as I had mentioned earlier. And I think our supply chain actually does very good considering the shortages because it's a fast-moving supply chain. The cycle times are very short. There's very little distance between a chip being fabricated and packaged and a product being -- going out of factory.

Q1_2022,Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah. Amit, what we've said in terms of December and March was that it's very difficult to estimate with great precision the constraints. But we said that they would be more than the Q4 or more than the September quarter, and we're saying that March will be less than the December quarter. And so that's the kind of verbiage that we placed around it. In terms of is it still challenging, yes, it is challenging. And for us, we pride ourselves on getting products to customers who really want them and try to do that in a fast basis. And so it's frustrating that we can't always do that at the speed that we would like. However, March is better than December. And so there's some encouraging sign there.

Q1_2022,Amit Daryanani,Evercore ISI -- Analyst,"Fair enough. Tim, I think one of the topics investors can struggle a fair a bit with Apple is really just sort of understand visibility around your product road map, and I think some of your tech peers tend to be more vocal about their initiative. Some of them go change their name when they find an initiative. You folks are spending, I think, $23 billion on R&D in '21. So you're really spending a fair amount. And maybe without telling us the road map, could you just talk about how do you think about where to focus your R&D resources on?

And I think that's proven successful for us. And other people can do it differently, of course. But it's been good for us over time to do that. So, we're going to continue to do that. In terms of deciding where we invest in, we look at areas that are sort of at the intersection of hardware, software, and services. And because we think that that's where the magic really happens, and it brings out the best in our home, and so there are areas that have more than piqued our interest, and we are investing in those.

But what we're seeing there was super impressive with all-time revenue records and a record number of upgraders and strong double-digit growth in switchers on iPhone, which is very important to us. And as I've mentioned before, we had the top four selling phones in urban China. And so there's a lot of good there. And I would remind you that iPhone was constrained in the quarter.

And if you could speak to the March quarter, perhaps in terms of seasonality and seasonal performance. And Luca, as you mentioned last year, because of the later launch of the phone that some of that came into the March quarter, and that was better than seasonal performance in March.

And -- but as Tim was saying, we still expect significant supply constraints but less than what we've seen in December. So I think on that basis, you can do the math around sequential.

And I've mentioned some of the geos that we track and how many units that we have on the top-selling model charts.

Tim, I had a question on the content on Apple TV. When we look at the Apple content that you guys put all on TV original content, it's typically very socially responsible and healthy, for example, at Ted Lasso.

So you guys have sort of cautiously approached healthcare with iWatch and iPhone. It's mostly a preventative sort of approach. It provides you updates. But do you see a situation down the line where Apple perhaps plays a more active role, either through the Watch or some of the device where perhaps a doctor or a hospital mandates that the watch we want for effectively for critical and vital monitoring?

Q4_2021,Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"Thanks, Tejas, and good afternoon, everyone. And thank you for joining the call today. A year ago, I spoke to you about the atmosphere of uncertainty in which we were living and the way it had come to define our daily experience, both as people and as a company. Today, much has changed, profoundly so. And while we are still living through unprecedented times, we are encouraged by progress around the world. I'm grateful to our teams who have stayed resolutely focused on our customers and the pursuit of innovation on their behalf. We've aimed to help our customers navigate the world as it is while empowering them to create the world as it can be. Whether it's public health workers managing vaccination campaigns on iPhone or students returning to classrooms full of iPads or families staying connected over face time, it is an honor to know that what we make matters and to see that reflected in the world and in our performance. This fiscal year, we reported $366 billion in revenue, which represents 33 percent annual growth. We also achieved more than 20 percent growth across all of our product categories and an average geographic segment. And today, Apple is reporting another very strong quarter. Demand was very robust and we set a new September quarter record of $83.4 billion, up 29 percent from last year and in line with what we discussed on our last call despite larger-than-expected supply constraints. During fiscal 2021, we aren't nearly one-third of our revenue from emerging markets and doubled our business in India and Vietnam. We are optimistic about the future, especially as we see strong demand for our new products. At the end of the September quarter, we introduced our iPhone 13 lineup, as well as the Apple Watch Series 7, iPad, and iPad mini, all of which represent significant advances. The iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 mini, alongside the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max are setting a new standard with their superfast performance, advanced camera systems, longer battery life, and brilliant, Super Retina displays. Customers are loving the ninth generation iPad, which features a beautifully sharp display and twice the storage of the previous generation, as well as the new iPad mini with its ultra-portable design and impressive speed and performance. And we've been thrilled with the reviews that Apple Watch Series 7 has earned for its larger display, faster charging, and refined design. And just last week, we introduced the completely reimagined MacBook Pro, powered by the extraordinary M1 Pro and M1 Max chips. These are our most powerful notebooks ever with game-changing performance and battery life and the world's best notebook display. We think customers are going to love MacBook Pro, whether they're editing video in Final Cut Pro or making music in Logic Pro and so much more. They'll be able to do things never before possible on a notebook. We also announced our all-new AirPods that feature spatial audio and industry-leading sound, longer battery life, and an all-new design. For the Home, we added three new colors to our HomePod mini lineup, which offers seamless integration across Apple's products and services. We also announced a new subscription tier to Apple Music called Apple Music Voice, which offers subscribers access to the services catalog of 90 million songs, all through the power of Siri. Across the board, teams at Apple continue to drive unmatched innovation through the seamlessly integrated hardware-software experience we've long prided ourselves on. iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 have created more ways than ever to stay productive, whether choosing Focus to avoid distractions or Quick Note to capture a thought. macOS Monterey offers new ways to connect with friends and family, get more done, and work fluidly across Apple devices. And watchOS 8 has made Apple Watch even more powerful and more ways than ever to stay active and to track your health on the go. We've never had a more diverse range of services for our customers to choose from and we've been very encouraged by our performance, which reflects growing customer enthusiasm and satisfaction. In just its first two years, Apple TV+ has already proved itself to fans around the world. And I want to congratulate the incredible actors, writers, storytellers, producers, and everyone else whose behind-the-scenes work has made that success possible. This quarter, Apple TV+ won 11 Emmys, including the award for Outstanding Comedy Series for Ted Lasso. That show has continued to bring light and laughter to fans all over the world with its boundless optimism and beloved cast of characters. We couldn't be more proud of our entire lineup of content from the gripping second seasons of The Morning Show and Truth Be Told to our newest programs, Swagger, which is out tomorrow. The response has been incredible. This quarter also saw major updates to Fitness+, including the addition of new activities like meditation and Pilates and the announcement of Group Workouts, a feature that brings fitness and friends together. We also share that Fitness+ will soon be available in 15 new countries, bringing workouts for every age and skill level to millions of more people around the world. And those are just two of the services our customers are loving. This quarter, Apple Card won a JD Power Award for customer satisfaction in its very first year of eligibility. The App Store continues to help people find the apps they depend on to stay productive, creative, and entertained. And on Apple News, we launched a news partner program that expands Apple's support for journalism, while creating an even better business opportunity for publishers. And we continue to support our customers around the world. We're glad to report we've opened several new Apple stores. This quarter, we opened a beautiful store in Changsha, which is our first store in the Hunan Province of China. We also just opened our third store in Istanbul and we recently added a store in the Bronx, which means we are now in all five boroughs of New York City. All of our stores are now open worldwide and have been for seven weeks. As we enter our busiest time of year, I particularly want to share my gratitude for our retail teams. Customers have never relied on our products more and our retail teams have truly answered the call. We meet our customers where they are. We have many ways to shop through our online and retail stores and can help them choose the best product for them and get it up and running. We are also excited about our education initiatives. This month, we introduced the Everyone Can Code Early Learners program, offering free resources which helps students in elementary school learn coding. We see education not only as a fundamental good in its own right but as a great equalizing force. A world where all people can access a quality education isn't just a smarter world, it's a more equitable one. That desire to create a more just and equitable world is the guiding principle behind our racial equity and justice initiative. This quarter, Apple shared plans to expand our hundred-million-dollar investment by an additional $30 million. Those funds will be used in a number of ways, including the creation of a new Global Hispanic Serving Institution Equity Innovation Hub. The Hub will dramatically expand the technology and resources for students in the STEM fields. Those programs join our ever-expanding work with historically black colleges and universities, including the now 45 community coding centers and regional hubs, serving underrepresented communities across the United States. This month, we were also happy to welcome the inaugural class of developers and entrepreneurs to the Apple Developer Academy in Detroit. The academy is Apple's first in the United States and is designed to help prepare students for jobs in the thriving iOS app economy, which supports more than 2.1 million jobs across all 50 states. In August, we shared our impact accelerator's first cohort of Black, Latinx, and Indigenous on businesses, whose pioneering work in green technology and clean energy serves many of the communities most impacted by climate change. More broadly, we are already carbon-neutral as a company. And this quarter, we made new strides toward reaching our goal of carbon-neutrality across our entire supply chain and the lifecycle of our devices by 2030. We've made significant product advances in this area. IPad and iPad mini now come with 100 percent recycled aluminum enclosure. The antenna on iPhone 13 is made up of upcycled plastic water bottles, which marks an industry-first. And as our customers are seeing when they purchase iPhone 13, we've redesigned the packaging to eliminate the outer plastic wrap, which will allow us to avoid using 600 metric tons of plastic. This brings us closer to removing all plastic in our packaging by 2025. We've also made good progress toward our goal to one day make our products without taking anything from the earth. With Apple Watch Series 7, for example, 99 percent of the rare earth elements we use are recycled. Ahead of COP26, I'm also pleased to report that we have more than doubled the number of our suppliers who have committed to becoming carbon-neutral by 2030. We're very encouraged to see the growth in this area and we will continue to drive those changes in the supply chain in the months and years to come. We've never viewed our environmental work as a side project. Teams across Apple are pushing this work forward in the same spirit of innovation we bring to our products and services. We are determined to be a ripple in the pond that drives a far greater change. From the pandemic to climate change to inequity and injustice. Global challenges won't abide solitary solutions and we feel a deep sense of responsibility to help. We are incredibly proud of the product lineup we have going into the holiday season and we are encouraged by the customer response we've seen. And while we cannot know exactly which path the pandemic will take the world down in the months to come, we feel quite confident that this new year will be driven by the values that guide us and by the innovation that defines us. With that, I'll hand it over to Luca for a deeper dive on our performance this quarter. Luca?",positive,0.89431715,Strong Positive,Slightly Positive,0.3,0.5,0.2,0,0,Strong Positive
Q4_2021,Luca Maestri,Chief Financial Officer,"Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to report very strong financial results for the September quarter, capping a record-setting fiscal year 2021. We set a September quarter revenue record of $83.4 billion, an increase of nearly $19 billion or 29 percent from a year ago despite larger-than-expected supply constraints. We also reached new Q4 records in every geographic segment with strong double-digit growth in each one of them. And it was a record September quarter for both products and services. On the product side, revenue was $65.1 billion, up 30 percent over a year ago as we experienced better-than-expected demand for our products despite supply constraints that we estimated at around $6 billion. We grew in each of our product categories with an all-time record for Mac and September quarter records for iPhone, for iPad, and for wearables, home, and accessories. Services gross margin was 70.5 percent, up 70 basis points sequentially, mainly due to a different mix. Net income of $20.6 billion and diluted earnings per share of $1.24 both grew over 60 percent year over year and were September quarter records. Let me get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. IPhone revenue grew 47 percent year over year and set a September quarter record of $38.9 billion despite supply constraints as customer demand was very strong. The iPhone 12 family continued to perform very well and we are seeing enthusiastic customer response to the launch of our iPhone 13 family. We also grew double digits in each geographic segment, setting September quarter records in both developed and emerging markets. The latest survey of US consumers from 451 Research indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 98 percent for iPhone. And our active installed base of iPhones reached a new all-time high. For Mac, we set an all-time revenue record of $9.2 billion despite supply constraints, driven by strong demand for our M1-powered MacBook Air. In fact, our last five quarters for Mac have been the best five quarters ever for the category. iPad performance was also strong with a September quarter revenue record of $8.3 billion, up 21 percent in spite of significant supply constraints as customer demand for the iPad Pro, also powered by M1, was very strong. For both Mac and iPad, we continue to see a combination of high levels of customer satisfaction and first-time buyers. Around half of the customers purchasing Mac and iPad during the quarter were new to that product. And in the most recent surveys of US consumers from 451 Research, customer satisfaction was 97 percent for both Mac and iPad. Our continued investment in iPad and Mac is taking computing to the next level. We have redesigned and reengineered both products to provide customers an unmatched experience, which resulted in record fiscal years for both categories. We are carrying this momentum also in the enterprise market. For example, SAP has already deployed Macs to tens of thousands of their employees to date. Following the launch of our new M1 MacBook Pro last week, SAP is planning to add it to the growing list of M1 Mac offerings available to their global center workforce. Another example is France's National Railway Company, SNCF, which equips all train drivers with iPads to manage their entire daily workflow and train operations, helping to lower energy and maintenance costs. In fact, the iPads have been so well-received that 90 percent of the drivers choose to purchase them for personal use at the end of the corporate device refresh cycle. Next, wearables, home, and accessories set a new September quarter record of $8.8 billion. We continue to improve and expand our product offerings in this category, which we believe improved the overall customer experience and showcased the integration between our products and services. Apple Watch, AirPods, and HomePod mini are powerful devices in their own right. But paired with our other products, software, and services, they create unique experiences like switching audio seamlessly between devices on your AirPods. Turning to services. As I mentioned, we reached an all-time revenue record of $18.3 billion with all-time records for cloud services, music, video, advertising, Apple Care, and payment services, and a September quarter record for the App Store. Our continued investment and strong execution in services has helped us deliver a record $68 billion in revenue during fiscal 2021, nearly tripling this category in six years. Also, paid subscriptions continue to show very strong growth. We now have more than 745 million paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, which is up more than 160 million from last year, and nearly five times the number of paid subscriptions we had less than five years ago. And finally, as Tim mentioned earlier, we're adding new services that we think our customers will love and we continue to improve the breadth and quality of our current services offerings. Fiscal '21 was not only a big year for services but for our entire company. During the past 12 months, we grew our business by 33 percent or $91 billion, reaching nearly $366 billion of revenue with record-level performance across the board. Every product category and every geographic segment set a new annual revenue record and was up at least 20 percent over fiscal 2020. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $191 billion in cash plus marketable securities. We issued $6.5 billion of new-term debt, retired $1.3 billion of term debt, and decreased commercial paper by $2 billion, leaving us with total debt of $125 billion. As a result, net cash was $66 billion at the end of the quarter as we continue to make progress toward our goal of net cash-neutral over time. As our business continues to generate very strong cash flow, we were also able to return $24 billion to shareholders during the September quarter. This included $3.6 billion in dividends and equivalents and $20 billion through open-market repurchases of 137 million Apple shares. We estimate the impact from supply constraints will be larger during the December quarter. Despite this challenge, we are seeing high demands for our products and expect to achieve very solid year-over-year revenue growth and to set a new revenue record during the September the December quarter. We expect revenue for each product category to grow on a year-over-year basis, except for iPad, which we expect to decline year over year due to supply constraints. For services, we expect our growth rate to decelerate from the September quarter but to remain strong. We expect gross margin to be between 41.5 percent and 42.5 percent. We expect opex to be between $12.4 billion and $12.6 billion. We expect OI and E to be around negative $50 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments and our tax rate to be around 16 percent. Finally, today, our board of directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.22 per share of common stock payable on November 11th, 2021, to shareholders of record as of November 8, 2021. With that, let's open the call to questions.",positive,0.943503857,Strong Positive,Slightly Positive,0.2,0.5,0.3,0,0,Strong Positive

Q4_2021,Shannon Cross,Cross Research LLC -- Analyst,"Thank you very much. Tim, I'm wondering, can you talk a bit more about specific supply chain issues you saw and how you've seen improvements, I think, during the current quarter? And, you know, how we should think about what products you expect to see most impacted going forward? Just any more color you can give us on what's going on out there because clearly, this is hitting everyone.",neutral,0.831237376,Neutral,Neutral,0,0,1,0,0,Neutral
Q4_2021,Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"Sure. If you look at Q4 for a moment, we had about $6 billion in supply constraints and it affected the iPhone the iPad and the Mac. We had -- there were two causes of them for Q4. One was the chip shortages that you've heard a lot about from many different companies through the industry. And the second was COVID-related manufacturing disruptions in Southeast Asia. The second of those, the COVID disruptions have improved materially across October to where we currently are. And so for this quarter, we think that the primary cause of supply chain-related shortages will be the chip shortage. It'll affect -- I -- it is affecting I should say pretty much most of our products currently. And -- but from a demand point of view, demand is very robust. And so, part of this is that demand also is very strong. But we believe that by the time we finish the quarter that the constraints will be larger than the $6 billion that we experienced in Q4.",negative,0.719310522,Slightly Negative,Neutral,0,0,1,0,0,Slightly Negative
Q4_2021,Shannon Cross,Cross Research LLC -- Analyst,"OK. Great. So, you'll sort of push forward in the next quarter as well. Can you -- just a different question because I'm curious. You're starting to sell more and more things on a ratable basis. And how are you thinking about that? I mean, you have, you know, the new Maxima app. We keep seeing, you know, you can buy for a monthly -- the charge in that. How do you think that's driving sales and how should we think about, you know, percent maybe of the portfolio that's now available? And I don't know if you want to tell us how much revenue is now under a recurring nature. But it's -- it definitely seems that you're shifting more and more to maybe sort of a bundled sale or, you know, offering from a consumer standpoint where you just pay one price every month and you get, you know, all of your Apple devices and Apple services. Thank you.",neutral,0.887407601,Neutral,Neutral,0,0,1,0,0,Neutral
Q4_2021,Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah. The first product, Shannon, that really sold on a monthly basis was iPhone. And that began to happen in the US, as an example, shortly after the subsidy kind of world changed markedly. And so, I would say that predominantly, the mode of buying an iPhone in the United States is on a monthly kind of plan today. For the balance of the products, still the most popular would be buying them outright but we are seeing more and more demand for monthly payments. And so, we want to give the customer what they want. And so, you will see us do more and more things like that that will meet the customer where -- and provide the price that they want in a way that they want to pay for it. I don't know the percentage of products that are sold that way today but it is increasing.",neutral,0.820765853,Neutral,Neutral,0,0,1,0,0,Neutral

Q4_2021,Amit Daryanani,Evercore ISI -- Analyst,"Perfect. Thanks a lot and good afternoon, everyone. I have two as well. You know, it gets -- when I think about the supply chain headwinds, you're talking about $6 billion in September, getting bigger in December. You know, Tim, I'd love to understand how do you guys come forward that this is really demand that's getting deferred versus potentially getting destroyed or going somewhere else? And if you think about the supply chain bottlenecks, you know, you were the COO, you manage a lot of the stuff. Do you feel comfortable that it sort of peaks in December and alleviates from there? Or what does that trajectory look like for improvement?",neutral,0.845845103,Neutral,Neutral,0,0,1,0,0,Neutral
Q4_2021,Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"You know, what I feel comfortable on is I feel like we've made great progress on the COVID-related disruptions. And that happened across the month of October and we're in a materially better position today. It is difficult to predict COVID, and so I'm not going to predict where it goes. But I can just tell you that as of today, we're in a materially better position than we were in September and in the first several weeks of October. In terms of the chip shortage, that chip shortage is happening on legacy nodes, primarily with bottom supply. And it's difficult to forecast when those things will balance because you'd have to know how -- kind of how the economy is going to be in 2022 and the accuracy of everyone else's demand projections. And so, I don't feel comfortable in making a prediction. I think it would be, you know, would be subject to too much inaccuracy. But I do feel very comfortable with our operational team. I think we've got a world-class one and I'm sure they're doing everything they can do to collapse cycle times and improve yields and do all the things that you can do in addition to fundamental capacity investment to remedy the situation.",neutral,0.686772406,Neutral,Neutral,0,0,1,0,0,Neutral
Q4_2021,Amit Daryanani,Evercore ISI -- Analyst,"Luca, if I may ask you a question on gross margins. For December, you know, you're essentially guiding gross margins to be flat to maybe down a little bit for September. You know, maybe just about -- because I think, historically, I would have expected gross margins to be up in December given how much revenue leverage you end up with. So, maybe one of the puts and takes on gross margins that are resulting in a more flattish guide versus historical seasonality.",negative,0.539620638,Slightly Negative,Neutral,0,0,1,0,0,Neutral
Q4_2021,Luca Maestri,Chief Financial Officer,"Well as, you know, the -- typically, you know, obviously, with December being the holiday season, we do get leverage, as you say, but it's also the period of the year where we launch a lot of new products. And as, you know, we launch, essentially in every product category, we launch new products. Demand is very strong but, as you know, when when we launch these new products, we tend to add higher cost structures at the beginning of the cycle. And so, that's what balances this out. Obviously, from a year-over-year standpoint, it's actually a significant expansion, right? Because when you look at what we did a year ago in the December quarter, 39.8 percent.

Q4_2021,Katy Huberty,Morgan Stanley -- Analyst,"Thank you. Given the supply chain is blurring the demand picture for iPhone 13, what data points can you share that help investors understand whether demand is tracking to a product cycle that is flat, growing, or down from the very strong iPhone 12. And maybe on that front, Luca, you can also comment on where you exited the quarter from a channel inventory standpoint for iPhone relative to a normal product cycle.

Q4_2021,Luca Maestri,Chief Financial Officer,"Yeah. Look, maybe I can take both of those.

In terms of the blurring of demand, we look at -- Katie, we look at a number of different data points. We look at demand across our online store, demand in retail. The -- we look through to backorders on the carrier channels, the ones that do take backorders there. We look at channel orders as well. And so, we have a number of different data points that we use to conclude how strong demand is and we feel very very good about where demand is right now.

Q4_2021,Katy Huberty,Morgan Stanley -- Analyst,"And, Tim, as a follow-up. We've recently surveyed 4,000 consumers in the US and China. And the feedback is most of them don't want to pay for apps or services direct to the developer, they value the security privacy ease of transactions of the App Store. So, how do you think about balancing the regulators push for more choice with a customer base that's happy with the existing experience.

Q4_2021,Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"Katy, the main thing that we're focused on on the App Store is to keep our focus on privacy and security. And so, these are the two major tenets that have produced over the years a very trusted environment where consumers and developers come together and consumers can trust the developers on the -- developers and the apps or what they say they are, and the developers get a huge audience to sell their software too. And so, that's sort of No. 1 on our list. Everything else is a distant second. And so, what we're doing is working to explain the decisions that we've made that are key to keeping the privacy and security there, which is to not have sideloading and not have alternate ways on the iPhone where it opens up the iPhone to unreviewed apps and also gets by the privacy restrictions that we've put on the App Store.

Q4_2021,David Vogt,UBS -- Analyst,"Great. Thank you, guys, and just two quick questions. One big picture, theoretical. So, you know, you've covered the supply chain in pretty extensive detail on the call. But maybe just the bigger picture on how you're thinking about it philosophically given what you just sort of went through over the last 12 to 8 months. So, what I mean by that is there's sort of a recalibration needed or an adjustment around your supply chain philosophy, either from a partner perspective or maybe a regional perspective. And, you know, how do you think about the infrastructure and visibility to sort of rebound and sort of handle sort of these disruptions that seem to crop up from time to time?

Q4_2021,Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah. I don't see a fundamental error that we've made, if that's what you're picking at, in terms of creating the environment that we're in. It was created for a number of reasons. The pandemic came along. Some people in the industry and some people outside the industry thought that the pandemic would reduce demand, they pulled their orders down, things reset. And what really happened was demand went up and went up even more than the -- than a straight trend would predict. And so, the industry is working through that now. I'm making it a little overly simplistic. There are some other things like yields and things like that that are happening as well, but those things are mainly manageable in the course of time. And so, what we're doing is working with our partners on making sure that they have supply that we need and making sure that our demand statements are accurate as we see them and so forth. And at the same time, we are reducing our lead times and cycle times, so that when you get a chip off of fab that -- as quickly as possible, it's in a product and shipping. And, you know, and also helping the fab partners increase their yields. And so, those things are things that we're doing. We also support the CHIPS Act and the investment there to put more investment in the ground.

And maybe just as a quick follow-up, you know, when you think about, you know, purchasing devices ratably, you touched on that earlier. But maybe can you just touch on, you know, the partnerships that you have with carriers and the support that they have given you over the last couple of years that's been a key component of your success? You know, the type of relationships that you have globally. You know, do you think sort of this business model as it's currently sort of, you know, put together globally is sort of a permanent structure?

We have mutual interests and the customer benefits hugely from getting a new 5G phone that has 5G and a number of other features in it, too. And so, I think everybody's aligned on purpose. The model that you paint is -- I wouldn't call it a global model because there are different variations around the world depending upon the country.

The reason that we did this is that, as you know, if you've followed us for a while, we believe strongly that privacy is a basic human right. And over -- and we believed that for decades, not just in the last year or so. And we've historically rolled out more and more features over time for -- to place the decision of whether to share data and what data to share in the hands of the user, where we believe that it belongs.

Q4_2021,Samik Chatterjee,J.P. Morgan -- Analyst,"Great. Hi. Thanks a lot for taking my question. I guess, Tim, I wanted to first to start off on your comment about strong demand across products. And just relative to iPhone 13 if you can give us a bit more insight about what are you seeing in terms of intent, in terms of either upgraders from the installed base or even switchers, relative to -- if you can compare it to iPhone 12. Because some of the feedback we are getting is, for example, a strong switching activity in China. So, just wondering if you can get a bit more granular there in terms of the -- what's driving this demand and who is it coming from. And then have a follow-up, please.",neutral,0.85567522,Neutral,Slightly Positive,0.1,0.5,0.3,0.1,0,Neutral
Q4_2021,Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"It's so early to talk about iPhone 13 because it's only been on the market for less than 30 days now. What I can tell you is going into the cycle, if you look at our results from last quarter, we grew on upgraders and switchers in the double digits. And so, both were very meaningful for the iPhone results last quarter. And so, there's a -- there's significant momentum in iPhone and that -- and I would clearly characterize the demand that we're seeing currently as robust as you can tell from the -- some of the quotes that we're quoting on the online store.",positive,0.536996424,Slightly Positive,Slightly Positive,0.2,0.5,0.2,0.1,0,Slightly Positive
Q4_2021,Samik Chatterjee,J.P. Morgan -- Analyst,"OK. And as a follow-up, I guess back to the supply chain but I wanted to just ask more relative to cost implications there. And what we're hearing is not only details but also component cost going up. So, as we look to -- well, as I think about this upcoming cycle, how are you looking to manage component cost-related headwinds? And is that something you're seeing through -- coming through the supply chain? Thank you.",neutral,0.826960027,Neutral,Neutral,0.1,0.2,0.5,0.1,0.1,Neutral
Q4_2021,Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"We've put our current thoughts in the gross margin guidance that we gave you, the 41.5 percent to 42.5 percent.

Q4_2021,Jim Suva,Citi -- Analyst,"Thank you. And I'll ask both my questions at the same time. Probably the first one is for Tim. On the services revenue, much better than expected. You know, can you give us some details about what drove that? Was that Apple Store is more open so more Apple Care or more Apple One or Arcade or TV or Fitness? And then probably for Luca on supply chain. When you mentioned, you know, supply chain headwinds going to get worse and you mentioned $6 billion this quarter, there's two ways to think about your terminology of worse. Is it the delta from $2 billion that you identified three months ago that went to $6 billion? So, therefore, the delta of $4 billion gets worse? Or you're just saying -- and therefore, it's above $10 billion for December quarter? Are you just saying it just gets higher than the $6 billion that you just identified earlier in the call? Thank you so much to you and your team.",neutral,0.735719144,Neutral,Slightly Positive,0.1,0.5,0.3,0.1,0,Neutral
Q4_2021,Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"Jim, I'm going to take the second question that you asked and Luca can take the first one on services. It's just in the reverse of the way you're calling that. On the supply constraints, what we're saying is that the number -- the amount of -- the nominal amount of supply constraints for Q1, we estimate to be larger than $6 billion. And so, you -- it's important to know that we're getting a lot more supply in Q1 than we had in Q4, obviously, because our sequential growth is significant and we have very solid growth year over year. And so, the amount of supply is growing dramatically. It's just that the demand is so robust that we envision having supply constraints for the quarter.",neutral,0.651000202,Neutral,Neutral,0.1,0.2,0.5,0.1,0.1,Neutral
Q4_2021,Luca Maestri,Chief Financial Officer,"And, Jim, on services, the 26 percent growth rate that we had was better than what we were expecting at the beginning of the quarter. And it was really across the board. It's difficult to single out the specific area because we set all-time records on cloud, we set, you know, all-time records across the board. Apple Care, music, video, advertising, payments services. The App Store was a September quarter record. So, it was strong across the board. You know, when we look at the services business, we always think about some fundamental factors that allow us to have good visibility over the sustainability of the business, right? The fact that the installed base continues to grow, that's obviously a positive. The fact that the number of people that are actually paying on the platform continues to grow double digits, and so that obviously increases our opportunity. The number of subscriptions that we have on the platform, we mentioned during the call 745 million paid subs. Right now, it's an increase of 160 million versus just 12 months ago, right? And obviously, the fact that we continue to launch new services and new offerings within the services that we already have, new features that, you know, obviously, gives us a lot of momentum going forward. We're very fortunate. We have a very -- now, it's a very large business, $68 billion in the last 12 months, and very diversified. We, you know, we sell a lot of different services and our customers seem to really enjoy the experience that they have on the platform.",positive,0.830239594,Slightly Positive,Slightly Positive,0.2,0.5,0.2,0.1,0,Slightly Positive

Q4_2021,Chris Caso,Raymond James -- Analyst,"Yes. Thank you. My first question, it's a question about your ability to recapture sales that you weren't able to fill in Q4, Q1, and Q2. And you have some experience in that from last year when the iPhone, not all the models, wanted at the same time, and some are late. And you did recapture some of that as you went past the holidays. Do you think that we should expect similar behavior this year? And then with that also is will all product categories behave similarly? Meaning that they are the same.

Q4_2021,Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"I think there are some products that people buy as gifts, that if it's not there, that it's perishable.

Q4_2021,Chris Caso,Raymond James -- Analyst,"OK. As a follow-up, could you speak to iPhone mix? One of the things we noted is that the delivery time for all iPhones are a bit long because of the constraints. They're a bit longer on the Pro and the Max. Is that a function of supply or demand or perhaps both? And again, I would imagine you have a little better handle on that this year given that all the phones will be launched at the same time.",neutral,0.894919813,Neutral,Neutral,0.1,0.2,0.5,0.1,0.1,Neutral

Q4_2021,Harsh Kumar,Piper Sandler -- Analyst,"Yeah. Hey, guys. First of all, great job managing to this supply constraint. It's obviously affecting everybody, so congratulations. And then, Tim, one for you. A strategic question. When Apple thinks about strategic areas that, as a company that went on, for example, software as high priority. But you're also one of the largest semiconductor companies if the company was stand-alone. So, curious about the kind of input and thinking that goes into owning some piece of technology. For example, when we survey people, they say batteries and screens are very important.

Q4_2021,Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"We look at ones where we believe we can make a substantial difference and have a level of differentiation. And so, you know, we've put a lot of energy in the silicon space because we have felt that we could design and develop products that we could not if we were in the -- just buying what's available in the commercial market. And as you can see more recently, we made that call on the Mac as well and have shifted to our own chips there. And so, it really depends on whether we see a way to do something that's differentiated or not. And I wouldn't want to rule anything out. It's more of whether or not we see our way clear to doing something that is materially better. We feel like we've done very well.",neutral,0.803528309,Neutral,Neutral,0.1,0.2,0.5,0.1,0.1,Neutral

Q4_2021,Harsh Kumar,Piper Sandler -- Analyst,"Thank you for that, Tim. And then I've got one for Luca. I want to go back to a question that Amit asked earlier in the call about gross margin. So, when I look at the September quarter, services obviously grew much faster than the product business, margin was down, and the same thing for December. But I think you're effectively saying that there's a lot of new product launches. Would that not go into opex, for example, marketing, etc., as opposed to COGS?

Q4_2021,Luca Maestri,Chief Financial Officer,"There is certainly, obviously, that we have launch expenses, you know, in marketing and advertising, of course, when we launch new products. But the reality -- what happens -- we always make our products better and -- which means adding new technology and new features to the product. So, typically, when you move from one generation of products to the next one, the cost structures tend to be higher, particularly at the beginning of the cycle. And so, when you make that transition, there is always some level of margin compression from the transition to a new product. The other aspect that you need to think about is the fact that the December quarter is the holiday season. And so, the percentage of products business that we have in the holiday quarter is higher than what we have in the September quarter, for example. And therefore, as you know, because the services margins are higher than the products margin, there's also a mix between the products and services business that plays into that -- the gross margins for the company, right?
