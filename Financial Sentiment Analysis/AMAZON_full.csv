Q1_2024,Dave Fildes,"Director, Investor Relations","They just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right nowâ€¦ *Stock Advisor returns as of August 18, 2025 In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions, and customer demand and spending, including the impact of recessionary fears, inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, cloud services, and new and emerging technologies, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.

Q1_2024,Andy Jassy,Chief Executive Officer,"Thanks, Dave. Today, we're reporting $143.3 billion in revenue, up 13% year over year, excluding the impact from foreign exchange rates; $15.3 billion in operating income, up 221% year over year or $10.5 billion; and $48.8 billion in trailing 12-month free cash flow adjusted for equipment finance leases, up $53.2 billion year over year. We remain focused on driving better experiences for our customers while also delivering efficiency improvements. Our financial results are an encouraging reminder of the progress we're making. Starting with our stores business, despite having hundreds of millions of items and the broadest selection available, we remain intensely focused on adding even more selection. One way is to continue adding brands we know our customers want. For instance, in the US, we recently welcomed Clinique and two Gen Z fashion favorites, Parade and Cider, and announced a collaboration with Hardly Ever Worn It in Europe to offer customers pre-owned items from luxury brands. Another way to drive selection is to make it easier for our third-party sellers to add their products to our store. We've recently launched a new generative AI tool that enables sellers to simply provide a URL to their own website, and we automatically create high-quality product detail pages on Amazon. Already, over 100,000 of our selling partners have used one or more of our GenAI tools. We remain focused on making sure we're offering everyday low prices, which we know is even more important to our customers in this uncertain economic environment. As our results show, customers are shopping but remain cautious, trading down on price when they can and seeking out deals. In Q1, we helped customers save with shopping events worldwide, including our first big spring sale in Canada and the US. We also held spring deal days in Europe and our Ramadan event in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE. Delivery speed really matters to customers, and we've continued to get faster while improving our safety performance. In this past Q1, we delivered to Prime members at our fastest speeds ever. In March, across our top 60 largest US metro areas, nearly 60% of Prime members orders arrived the same or next day. And globally, in cities like Toronto, London, and Tokyo, about three out of four items were delivered the same or next day. Faster delivery times have another important effect. As we get items to customers this fast, customers choose Amazon to fulfill their shopping needs more frequently, and we can see the results in various areas, including how fast our everyday essentials business is growing and the continued increase in Prime member purchase frequency and total spend with us. Over the past year, we've talked about how our regionalization efforts have helped to lower our cost to serve. We've continued to inspect our fulfillment network for additional opportunities and are working on several areas where we believe we can lower costs even further while also improving customer experience. One example of this is our work to increase the consolidation of units into fewer boxes. As we further optimize our network, we've seen an increase in the number of units delivered per box, an important driver for reducing our cost. When we're able to consolidate more units into a box, it results in fewer boxes and deliveries, a better customer experience, reduces our cost to serve, and lowers our carbon impact. Another prominent example is our efforts to revamp our US inbound fulfillment architecture to allow for better inventory placement closer to our customers. This will be an iterative process throughout the year as we work with sellers and retail partners, and teams are making good progress on their plans. Advertising performance remained strong with ad sales up 24% year over year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. The strength in advertising was primarily driven by sponsored products, supported by continued improvements in relevancy and measurement capabilities for advertisers. We still see significant opportunity ahead in our sponsored products, as well as areas where we're just getting started like Prime Video ads. Prime Video ads offers brands value as we can better link the impact of streaming TV advertising to business outcomes like product sales or subscription sign-ups, whether the brands sell on Amazon or not. It's very early for streaming TV ads but we're encouraged by the early response. Moving to AWS. Year-over-year revenue growth accelerated to 17.2% in Q1, up from 13.2% in Q4. It's useful to remember that year-over-year percentages are only relevant relative to the total base from which you start. And given our much larger infrastructure cloud computing base, at this growth rate, we see more absolute dollar growth again quarter over quarter in AWS than we can see elsewhere. We're seeing a few trends right now. First, companies have largely completed the lion's share of their cost optimization and turned their attention to newer initiatives. Before the pandemic, companies were marching to modernize their infrastructure, moving from on-premises infrastructure to the cloud to save money, innovated at a more rapid rate, and to drive more developer productivity. The pandemic and uncertain economy that followed distracted from that momentum, but it's picking up again. Companies are pursuing this relatively low-hanging fruit in modernizing their infrastructure. And with the broadest functionality by a fair bit, deepest partner ecosystem and strong security and operational performance, AWS continues to be their strong partner of choice. Our AWS customers are also quite excited about leveraging GenAI to change the customer experiences and businesses. We see considerable momentum on the AI front where we've accumulated a multibillion-dollar revenue run rate already. You heard me talk about our approach before, and we continue to add capabilities at all three layers of the GenAI stack. At the bottom layer, which is for developers and companies building models themselves, we see excitement about our offerings. We have the broadest selection of NVIDIA compute instances around, but demand for our custom silicon, training, and inference is quite high, given its favorable price performance benefits relative to available alternatives. Larger quantities of our latest generation, Trainium 2 is coming in the second half of 2024 and early 2025. Companies are also starting to talk about the eye-opening results they're getting using SageMaker, our managed end-to-end service has been a game changer for developers in preparing their data for AI, managing experiments, training models faster, lowering inference latency, and improving developer productivity. Perplexity AI trains models 40% faster than SageMaker, Workday reduces inference latency by 80% with SageMaker, and NatWest reduces its time to value for AI from 12 to 18 months to under seven months using SageMaker. This change is how challenging it is to build your own models, and we see an increasing number of model builders standardizing on SageMaker. The middle layer of the stack is for developers and companies who prefer not to build models from scratch, but rather seek to leverage an existing large language model, or LLM, customize it with their own data, and have the easiest and best features available to deploy secure high-quality, low-latency, cost-effective production GenAI apps. This is why we built Amazon Bedrock, which not only has the broadest selection of LLMs available to customers but also unusually compelling model evaluation, retrieval augmented generation, or RAG, to expand model's knowledge base, guardrails to safeguard what questions applications will answer, agents to complete multistep tasks, and fine-tuning to keep teaching and refining models. Bedrock already has tens of thousands of customers, including Adidas, New York Stock Exchange, Pfizer, Ryanair, and Toyota. In the last few months, Bedrock's added Anthropic's Claude 3 models, the best-performing models in the planet right now; Meta's Llama 3 models; Mistral's Various models, Cohere's newest models, and new first-party Amazon Titan models. A week ago, Bedrock launched a series of other features, but perhaps most importantly, Custom Model Import. Custom Model Import is a sneaky big launch as it satisfies a customer request we've heard frequently and that nobody has yet met. As increasingly more customers are using SageMaker to build their models, they're wanting to take advantage of all the Bedrock features I mentioned earlier that make it so much easier to build high-quality production-grade GenAI apps. Bedrock Custom Model Import makes it simple to import models from SageMaker or elsewhere into Bedrock before deploying their applications. Customers are excited about this, and as more companies find they're employing a mix of custom-built models along with leveraging existing LLMs, the prospect of these two linchpins services in SageMaker and Bedrock working well together is quite appealing. The top of the stack are the GenAI applications being built. And today, we announced the general availability of Amazon Q, the most capable generative AI-powered assistant for software development and leveraging company's internal data. On the software development side, Q doesn't just generate code, it also tests code, debugs coding conflicts, and transforms code from one form to another. Today, developers can save months using Q to move from older versions of Java to newer, more secure and capable ones. In the near future, Q will help developers transform their dotNET code as well, helping them move from Windows to Linux. Q also has a unique capability called agents, which can autonomously perform a range of tasks, everything from implementing features, documenting, and refactoring code to performing software upgrades. Developers can simply ask Amazon Q to implement an application feature such as asking it to create an add to favorites feature in a social sharing app, and the agent will analyze their existing application code and generate a step-by-step implementation plan, including code changes across multiple files and suggested new functions. Developers can collaborate with the agent to review and iterate on the plan, and then the agent implements it, connecting multiple steps together and applying updates across multiple files, code blocks and test suites. It's quite handy. On the internal data side, most companies have large troves of internally relevant data that resides in wikis, intranet pages, Salesforce, storage repositories like Amazon S3 and a bevy of other data stores and SaaS apps that are hard to access. It makes answering straightforward questions about company policies, products, business results, code, people, and many other topics hard and frustrating. Q makes this much simpler. You can point Q at all of your enterprise data repositories. And it will search all this data, summarize logically, analyze trends, engage in dialogue with customers about this data. We also introduced today a powerful new capability called Q Apps, which lets employees describe a natural language what apps they want to build on top of this internal data and Q Apps will quickly generate that app. This is going to make it so much easier for internal teams to build useful apps from their own data. Q is not only the most functionally capable AI-powered assistant for software development and data, but also setting the standard for performance. Q has the highest-known score and acceptance rate for code suggestions, outperforms all other publicly benchmarkable competitors and catching security vulnerabilities, and leads all software development assistants on connecting multiple steps together and applying automatic actions. Customers are gravitating to Q, and we already see companies like Brightcove, Bridge Telecom, Datadog, GitLab, GoDaddy, National Australia Bank, NCS, Netsmart, Slalom, Smartsheet, Sun Life, Tata Consultancy Services, Toyota, and Wiz using Q, and we've only been in beta until today. I'd also caution folks not to overlook the security and operational performance elements of these GenAI services. It's less sexy, but critically important. Most companies care deeply about the privacy of the data in their AI applications and the reliability of their training and production apps. If you've been paying attention to what's been happening in the last year or so, you can see there are big differences between providers on these dimensions. AWS has a meaningful edge, which is adding to the number of companies moving their AI focus to AWS. We expect the combination of AWS' reaccelerating growth and high demand for GenAI to meaningfully increase year-over-year capital expenditures in 2024, which given the way the AWS business model works is a positive sign of the future growth. The more demand AWS has, the more we have to procure new data centers, power and hardware. And as a reminder, we spend most of the capital upfront. But as you've seen over the last several years, we make that up in operating margin and free cash flow down the road as demand steadies out. And we don't spend the capital without very clear signals that we can monetize it this way. We remain very bullish on AWS. We're at $100 billion-plus annualized revenue run rate, yet 85% or more of the global IT spend remains on-premises. And this is before you even calculate GenAI, most of which will be created over the next 10 to 20 years from scratch and on the cloud. There is a very large opportunity in front of us. We also continue to make strong progress on our newer investments. Our emerging international stores are growing and moving toward profitability. Our third-party logistics business offering services like Buy with Prime, Amazon shipping and multichannel fulfillment continues to grow well. We just launched a Prime delivery grocery benefit that lets customers receive free unlimited grocery delivery for just $9.99 a month, which is great value and customers are responding accordingly. Later this year in Manhattan, we're launching a new smaller Whole Foods market concept called Whole Foods Market Daily Shop. Prime Video continues to produce compelling content with Fallout being our latest big hit on the heels of a very successful Roadhouse movie, with strong customer engagement in our original and partner content. Our health services business is growing robustly as customers are loving our pharmacy customer experience, and we've launched same-day delivery of prescription medications to customers in eight cities, including Los Angeles and New York City, with plans to expand to more than a dozen cities by the end of the year with customers now getting first fill medications 75% faster year over year nationwide. And Kuiper is getting closer to having its production satellites in space and entering our commercial data. There's a lot of invention happening across our business, and I'm super grateful to all our employees for their hard work and ingenuity. I'll close by sharing that I'm enthusiastic about how we started this year. We have a lot of opportunity in front of us in every one of our businesses to make our customers' lives better and easier. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian for a financial update.",neutral,0.909178376,Neutral,Slightly Positive,0.2,0.4,0.3,0.1,0,Slightly Positive
Q1_2024,Brian Olsavsky,Chief Financial Officer,"Thanks, Andy. Starting with our top line financial results. Worldwide revenue was $143.3 billion, representing a 13% increase year over year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and near the top end of our guidance range. I'd like to highlight a couple of points to help you interpret our growth rates. First, we saw an impact from leap year in Q1, which added approximately 120 basis points to the year-over-year quarterly revenue growth rate. Second, while I typically talk about growth rates, excluding the impact of year-over-year changes in foreign exchange, we did see an unfavorable impact from global currencies weakening against the US dollar, more than we had planned in Q1. This led to a $700 million or 50 basis point headwind to revenue relative to what we guided. Excluding this FX headwind, we would have exceeded the top end of our guidance range. Worldwide operating income was $15.3 billion, which was our highest quarterly income ever, and it was $3.3 billion above the high end of our guidance range. This was driven by strong operational performance across all three reportable segments and better-than-expected operating leverage, including lower cost to serve. The impact on operating income from our Q1 FX rate headwind was negligible. I'll speak more to our profitability trends in a moment. In the North America segment, first quarter revenue was $86.3 billion, an increase of 12% year over year. In the international segment, revenue was $31.9 billion, an increase of 11% year over year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. We remain focused on the inputs that matter most to our customers: selection, price, and convenience. During the quarter, around the world, we help customers save with our shopping events. We added selection, including premium and luxury brands, and we delivered our fastest speeds ever for Prime members. Third-party sellers continue to be an important part of our offering. Third-party seller services revenue increased 16% year over year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. We saw strong 3P unit growth, coupled with increased adoption of our optional services, such as fulfillment and global logistics. For the quarter, third-party seller unit mix was 61%, up 200 basis points year over year. Shifting to profitability, North America segment operating income was $5 billion, an increase of $4.1 billion year over year. Operating margin was 5.8%, up 460 basis points year over year. We saw improvements in our cost to serve, including continued benefit from our work to regionalize our operations, savings from more consolidated customer shipments, and improved leverage driven by strong unit growth and lower transportation rates. In our international segment, operating income was $903 million, an improvement of $2.2 billion year over year. Operating margin was 2.8%, up 710 basis points year over year. This is primarily driven by our established countries as we improve cost efficiencies through network design enhancements and improved volume leverage. Additionally, we saw good progress in our emerging countries as they expand their customer offerings and make strides on their respective journeys to profitability. Looking ahead, we see several opportunities to further lower cost to serve and improved profitability in our worldwide stores business while still investing to improve the customer experience. Within our fulfillment network, we are focused on investing in our inbound network, streamlining and standardizing process paths, and adding robotics and automation. These improvement opportunities will take time. However, we have a solid plan in place and we like the path we're on. Advertising remains an important contributor to profitability in North America and international segments. We see many opportunities to grow our offerings, both in the areas that are driving growth today like sponsored products and in areas that are newer, like streaming TV ads. Moving to AWS. Revenue was $25 billion, an increase of 17% year over year, and AWS is now a $100 billion annualized revenue run rate business. Excluding the impact from leap year, AWS revenue increased approximately 16% year over year. During the first quarter, we saw growth in both generative AI and non-generative AI workloads across a diverse group of customers and across industries as companies are shifting their focus toward driving innovation and bringing new workloads to the cloud. Additionally, we continue to see the impact of cost optimizations diminish. While there always be a level of ongoing optimization, we think the majority of the recent cycle is behind us, and we're likely closer to a steady state of these optimization efforts. AWS operating income was $9.4 billion, an increase of $4.3 billion year over year. As a reminder, these results include the impact from the change in the estimated useful life of our servers, which primarily benefits the AWS segment. We made progress in managing our infrastructure and fixed costs while still growing at a healthy rate, which has resulted in improved leverage. As we've said in the past, over time, we expect the AWS operating margins to fluctuate, driven in part by the level of investments we are making in the business. We remain focused on driving efficiencies across the business, which enables us to invest to support the strong growth we're seeing in AWS, including generative AI, which brings us to capital investments. As a reminder, we define these as the combination of capex plus equipment finance leases. In 2023, overall capital investments were $48.4 billion. As I mentioned, we're seeing strong AWS demand in both generative AI and our non-generative AI workloads, with customers signing up for longer deals, making bigger commitments. Still relatively early days in generative AI and more broadly, the cloud space, and we see sizable opportunity for growth. We anticipate our overall capital expenditures to meaningfully increase year over year in 2024, primarily driven by higher infrastructure capex to support growth in AWS, including generative AI. Turning to our revenue guidance for Q2. Net sales are expected to be between $144 billion and $149 billion or to grow between 7% and 11%, compared with the second quarter of 2023. We saw an unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange in our Q1 results, and we expect that headwind to grow in the second quarter. Our Q2 net sales guidance anticipates an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of approximately 60 basis points. As part of our guidance considerations, we also continue to keep an eye on consumer spending and macro level trends, specifically in Europe, where it appears to be a bit weaker relative to the US. Operating income is expected to be between $10 billion and $14 billion in Q2. This estimate includes the impact of our seasonal step-up in stock-based compensation expense, driven by the timing of our annual compensation cycle. I want to thank our customers, our partners, and our teammates around the world for a very strong start to the year, and we're excited to build on this momentum. We'll remain focused on streamlining and prioritizing projects in a way that allows us to continue inventing for customers in a cost-effective way. With that, let's move on to your questions. Operator At this time, we will now open the call up for questions. We ask each caller to please limit yourself to one question.  Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question.",positive,0.953807056,Strong Positive,Slightly Positive,0.2,0.4,0.3,0.1,0,Strong Positive
Q1_2024,Doug Anmuth,JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst,"Thanks so much for taking the question. Probably for both Andy and Brian. Historically, Amazon has shifted between periods of heavy investment and then margin expansion back into heavier investment, but you now have a much bigger base of gross profit and overall operating income. As you think about GenAI and capital intensity or grocery or cyber or healthcare, is there anything from an investment perspective that could materially impact profitability going forward in your view? Thanks.",neutral,0.871680796,Neutral,Neutral,0.1,0.2,0.5,0.1,0.1,Neutral
Q1_2024,Brian Olsavsky,Chief Financial Officer,"Hi. Doug, yeah, we have historically always mentioned that. You have seen like a pendulum shift sometimes between profitability and investment. I think we're at the stage now where we're doing both at the same time continually, so we are more apt to talk about the specific investments that we're making and how that might impact our short-term outlook. So, if you look at the progress we've made on operating income and free cash flow over really the last 18 months, a lot of it's driven by improvements in our stores business, lower cost to serve. We've talked about regionalization efforts and how that's moving into inbound areas now. Advertising has been growing strong and AWS has been strong. And you saw AWS margins increase 800 basis points sequentially off Q4. A lot of that's driven by cost controls and expanding revenue on the top line and lower cost structure throughout the company. We do see, though, on the capex side that we will be meaningfully stepping up our capex and the majority of that will be in our -- to support AWS infrastructure and specifically generative AI efforts. So, I would expect that it will increase depreciation, definitely in that segment. On the -- well, we're talking about capex. Right now, in Q1, we had $14 billion of capex. We expect that to be the low quarter for the year. As Andy said earlier, we are seeing strong demand signals from our customers and longer deals and larger commitments, many with generative AI components. So, those signals are giving us confidence in our expansion of capital in this area. And as he also mentioned, we've done this for 18 years. We invest capital and resources upfront. We create capacity very carefully for our customers. And then we see the revenue, operating income and free cash flow benefit for years to come after that, with strong returns on invested capital. So, a little bit of a long-winded answer to your question. But yes, we have -- the main issue that we'll see in the near term is additional capex and we've talked about that. And we continue to see strong capex performance in our stores business. Most of that will be related to modest capital or capacity increases in addition to our same-day fulfillment network and some Amazon Logistics upgrades to the fleet. But for the most part, what you'll see is really going to be on the AWS side.",positive,0.901178777,Strong Positive,Neutral,0.1,0.2,0.5,0.1,0.1,Strong Positive
Q1_2024,Andy Jassy,Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah, I just would add briefly, just to summarize. I understand where the question is coming from, Doug. And I think we're in a position to do both is the short answer. I think there's actually an opportunity in our existing large businesses and the stores business along with advertising and AWS, there's a lot of growth in front of us. And I think we're investing in a meaningful way. But I think we also -- we've been pretty consistent about don't believe that we're at the end of what we can do in terms of improving our cost structure on the store side. Yes, I think there are really unbelievable growth opportunities in front of us. And I think what people sometimes forget on the AWS side, it's a $100 billion revenue run rate business, that we're still 85-plus percent of the global IT spend is on premises. And if you believe that equation is going to flip, which we do, it means we have a lot of growth in front of us, and that's before the generative AI opportunity, which I don't know if any of us have seen a possibility like this in technology in a really long time, for sure, since the cloud, perhaps since the Internet. And unlike in the cloud, where so much -- there's a lot of work to be done to move from on-premises to the cloud, people do it and they get value out of it, which is why they modernize their infrastructure. But it's work. All of this generative AI set of workloads, which will transform every experience they're going to be built from scratch on the cloud largely. And so, it's just tremendous opportunities there along with some of the other areas that we're investing that are really early stage. So, I think it's both for us. Operator And our next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.",neutral,0.881291091,Neutral,Slightly Positive,0.2,0.4,0.3,0.1,0,Slightly Positive
Q1_2024,Ross Sandler,Barclays -- Analyst,"Hey, guys. Somewhat related question on capex intensity in AWS. So, I think the CEO of Anthropic has said that I think the next generation of models, costs in the neighborhood of $1 billion to train. This would be like Cloud 4, I guess, high end. And then the generation after that might be as much as $10 billion to train. So, is this something that you feel like the industry will do on top of AWS? Do you feel like Olympus and some of the stuff you're doing in-house needs to kind of stay at the state-of-the-art, or can others do that? And then how much did all this training have an impact on the acceleration that you saw in 1Q for AWS revenue? Thank you.",neutral,0.905530095,Neutral,Neutral,0.1,0.2,0.5,0.1,0.1,Neutral
Q1_2024,Andy Jassy,Chief Executive Officer,"Well, Ross, I would tell you that we have seen kind of three, I'll call it, macro trends that I think are contributing to AWS' performance, at least in the last quarter. First of all, I think the lion's share of cost optimization is behind us. So, I think companies will be smart and have learned a lot over the last number of months in how they run their infrastructure in the cloud. But I think the lion's share of the cost optimization is behind us. And I think people have moved to newer initiatives that I would, at a macro level, describe as modernizing their infrastructure and then trying to drive value at a generative. On the former, I think we were on this March before the pandemic, where most companies were trying to figure out how to move from on-premises to the cloud because it's more cost effective and it's faster to innovate and they get real developer productivity. And then the pandemic hit and people were in survival mode and the uncertain economy, you let people save costs wherever they could, and they got distracted on that. But they're back to pursuing and figuring it out because it's low-hanging fruit for them, and we see very significant growth in that space. And at the same time, we're seeing very significant momentum in people trying to figure out how to run their generative AI on top of AWS. I mentioned we have a multibillion-dollar revenue run rate that we see in AI already, and it's still relatively early days. And I think at a high level, there's a few things that we're seeing that's driving that growth. I think first of all, there are so many companies that are still building their models. And these range from the largest foundational model builders like Anthropic, you mentioned, to every 12 to 18 months or building new models. And those models consume an incredible amount of data with a lot of tokens, and they're significant to actually go train. And a lot of those are being built on top of AWS, and I expect an increasing amount of those to be built on AWS over time because our operational performance and security, as well as our chips, both what we offer from NVIDIA. But if you take Anthropic, as an example, they're training their future models on our custom silicon on Trainium. And so, I think we'll have a real opportunity for a lot of those models to run on top of AWS. I think the thing that people sometimes don't realize is that while we're in the stage that so many companies are spending money training models. Once you get those models into production, which not that many companies have, but when you think about how many generative AI applications will be out there over time, most will end up being in production when you see the significant run rates. You spend much more in inference than you do in training because you train only periodically, but you're spinning out predictions and inferences all the time. And so, we also see quite a few companies that are building their generative AI applications to do inference on top of AWS. And a lot of it has to do with the services. And the primary example we see there is how many companies, tens of thousands of companies, already are building on top of Amazon Bedrock, which has the largest selection of large language models around and a set of features that make it so much easier to build a high-quality, cost-effective low latency, production-grade generative AI applications. So, we see both training and inference being really big drivers on top of AWS. And then you layer on top of that the fact that so many companies, their models and these generative AI applications are going to have their most sensitive assets and data. And it's going to matter a lot to them what kind of security they get around those applications. And yes, if you just pay attention to what's been happening over the last year or two, not all the providers have the same track record. And we have a meaningful edge on the AWS side so that as companies are now getting into the phase of seriously experimenting and then actually deploying these applications to production, people want to run their generative AI on top of AWS.

Q1_2024,Brian Nowak,Morgan Stanley -- Analyst,"Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one is on cost to serve. I appreciate all the color in the shareholder letter and even tonight on cost to serve. Andy, maybe could you just help us quantify a little more how to think about some of your North Star cost to serve goals over the next couple of years? And what could that mean for potential accompanying reasonable ranges of outcomes for North America retail margins through all of that? And then the second one, if cost to serve does improve, I think it should lead to significant incremental cash flow even with more capex.

Thanks.",neutral,0.604448974,Neutral,Neutral,0.1,0.2,0.5,0.1,0.1,Neutral
Q1_2024,Brian Olsavsky,Chief Financial Officer,"Hey, Brian, this is Brian. I will start with your second question. So, as far as dividends or buybacks or any other capital structure moves, we don't have anything to share with you on that today. But I'll reacquaint you with our general philosophy. So, our first priority is to invest in -- to support the growth opportunities and long-term investments within our businesses. And generally, we still have many opportunities to put that capital to use that would generate meaningful returns, especially as you heard in generative AI. So, we're very -- we have a great deal of passion on that and conviction on that as well. We are reaching a different stage of free cash flow. As you mentioned, we had negative free cash flow for two years, 2021 and 2022, immediately after the pandemic as we had doubled the size of our operations network and had a lot of other expenses. That was followed by 2023 when we had our largest -- our highest free cash flow ever. And those trends have carried into Q1. So, we feel good about the free cash flow. We are, again, still anticipating higher capex this year. The other thing that we're doing with cash flow right now is we're repaying some of the debt that we had taken on during that negative free cash flow period. We have reached a high watermark at the end of Q1 last year. And since then and then through this year, we'll pay that down over $25 billion. So, that's our first priority, as well as 2024 capital expenditures, but otherwise, nothing to share on that front. I'll tee up, Andy, on the stores profitability because I know there's always generally the comment about how high can operating margins go and how do they compare to historic trends. And I think the same still holds. We look back to before the pandemic, and we say, first, we can achieve those operating margins even without the impact of advertising. And we're not quite there yet. But we're not limiting ourselves to that. We're looking for ways to, again, turn over every rock, look at every process and everything that we do on the logistics side and see how can we get our cost structure down and how can we get speed up and selection up. So, it's is working on a lot of fronts there, but cost is certainly front and center as we meet and improve customer experience.

Q1_2024,Youssef Squali,Truist Securities -- Analyst,"Great. Thank you very much. Andy, on logistics, in September, you launched Amazon supply chain. Can you just help us understand the opportunity you see there? Where are you in that journey to build logistics as a service on a global basis? And does that require a function increase in capex? Thank you.",positive,0.600907207,Slightly Positive,Neutral,0.1,0.2,0.5,0.1,0.1,Neutral
Q1_2024,Andy Jassy,Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah. Thanks for the question, Youssef. I think that it's interesting what's happening with our -- the business we're building in third-party logistics. And it really kind of, in some ways, mirrors some of the other businesses we've gotten involved in AWS being an example of it, even though it's -- they're very different businesses in that we realized that we had our own internal need to build a bunch of these capabilities. And we figured that there were probably others who had those same needs and we decided to build services out of them. So, as our business has grown, it turns out to be pretty hard work to actually import items from overseas, get them through customs and through the border and then ship them from that point to various facilities. And then it turns out that you don't want to store those facilities in fulfillment centers because that space is really scarce. So, you'd like to have them in upstream storage facilities that are very inexpensive. And then you'd like to have a way to be able to know when your more scarce supply in the fulfillment centers needs replenishment and be able to do it automatically from those upstream storage facilities. And so, all of those were capabilities that we had to build for ourselves to be to operate our stores business in the way that we wanted to and that our sellers wanted to. And so, we built that capability for ourselves first and then we opened up those services as individual services to our sellers. And so, we help sellers, we have a service that allows them to get items through the border and through customs. We have a service that allows them to ship from customs to various facilities, whether they're our own or their separate ones. We allow them to store items in our upstream low-cost warehouses that they can either automatically replenish into our fulfillment centers where we ship or they can move to other facilities that they have. We have a service that lets them -- where we'll ship either to our end customers if they're selling on Amazon or to their end customers. We obviously have buy with Prime, where we enable our prime customers to be able to buy from our third-party buy with Prime sellers websites, which increases their conversion 25% versus what they would do on their own, and it's a great benefit for our Prime customers. And then I would say that supply chain with Amazon is really an abstraction on top of those individual building block services I just mentioned that makes it easier for customers to have the whole end-to-end supply chain integrated. That collective set of businesses is growing very significantly. It's already what I would consider a reasonable sized business. And I think it's just really early days. It is not something that we anticipate being a giant capital expense driver for us. We have to build a lot of those capabilities anyway to handle our stores business, and we think we can it will be a modest increase on top of that to accommodate third-party sellers. But are third-party sellers find high value in us being able to manage those components for them versus having to do it themselves and they save money in the process. Operator And our next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.",neutral,0.891023636,Neutral,Slightly Positive,0.2,0.4,0.3,0.1,0,Neutral
Q1_2024,Justin Post,Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst,"Great. I thought I'd ask a couple of growth drivers that you mentioned. First, grocery, it seems like you're still changing the threshold for free delivery or the subscription prices. Just can you say at all how much that's contributing to your gross right now and do you think you're over the hump? Or are you optimistic this can be a really big category for you? And then maybe a little bit extra on Prime Video ramp, how that ramp went versus your expectations? And do you think that could be a meaningful contributor to ad revenues going forward? Thank you.",neutral,0.759161592,Neutral,Neutral,0.1,0.2,0.5,0.1,0.1,Neutral
Q1_2024,Andy Jassy,Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah. I'll take them in opposite order just on Prime Video ads. Very early days, just launched a few months ago. It's off to a really good start. I think advertisers are excited about being able to expand their ability to advertise with us in video beyond Twitch and Freevee to Prime video shows, movies, I think they also find that the relevancy and the measurability of that type of advertising and Prime Video ads is unique for them. So, it's off to a very good start. It's early days, but we're optimistic there. On grocery, I would tell you that we continue to be optimistic about what we're doing in grocery. We have a very large grocery business. It's kind of got a few different components. And we have a very, very significant non-perishables grocery business much the same way that the mass merchandisers entered this business 30 or 40 years ago. These are consumables and canned goods and pet food and healthcare and beauty products. That continues to grow at a very rapid rate. And we have an organic grocery business in Whole Foods Market, which is the pioneer in that space. And that business continues to grow very nicely. We're introducing a new smaller format in the fall in Manhattan and the Whole Foods Market daily shop idea. We've worked very hard on the profitability trajectory over the last 18 months and like the way that, that has taken shape. And then if you want to have -- do you want to serve as many grocery missions as we aim to serve. You have to have a perishables business and a mass physical presence. And that's what we've been working on with Amazon Fresh. We've launched our V2 format in physical stores over the last few months, primarily in Chicago and Southern California. We like the early results a lot. They're really meaningfully better in almost every dimension. It's still early, and there's some things to work through, but we like what we're seeing there. And then we have to decide the best way to roll those out over time. As you mentioned, Justin, we just launched a Prime benefit for grocery, which is you can eat delivery for $9.99 a month, which if you order once from Whole Foods a month, it pays for itself or once from Amazon Fresh for orders under $40, it pays for itself. It's a very valuable offering for our Prime members, and it's off to a great start. So, in my opinion, we have lots of ways that we can continue to help customers satisfy their grocery needs. And we have some building blocks that I think might also change how people split up their grocery orders over time. But I continue to be optimistic that, that's going to continue to grow for us. Operator And our final question will come from the line of Ron Josey with Citi. Please proceed with your question.",neutral,0.861610711,Neutral,Slightly Positive,0.2,0.4,0.3,0.1,0,Slightly Positive
Q1_2024,Ron Josey,Citi -- Analyst,"Great. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe, Andy, I wanted to ask on international profitability, just after 1Q's 2.8% margin. Talk just about where we are in terms of international getting or to consistent profitability. We're following a similar trajectory as North America in terms of benefiting from regionalization shift, and we saw what average distance of each package traveled actually came down by 25 kilometers and whatnot. And if you could provide any insights on maybe how inbound fulfillment architecture might add to just continued benefits on faster shipping, same-day, next day, et cetera? Thank you, Andy.",neutral,0.716176629,Neutral,Neutral,0.1,0.2,0.5,0.1,0.1,Neutral
Q1_2024,Brian Olsavsky,Chief Financial Officer,"Hey, Ron, I'm going to start with this one on international profitability. So, yes, in the quarter, our operating income was $902 million. And if you've watched that, we've seen a steady progression in operating income in our international segment, it's up $2.2 billion year over year. So, we like the trend there. It breaks down into a few areas. I would say the established countries of Europe, Japan, as well as the UK are following a lot of the same trajectory as in the United States. They are profitable in their own right. They are adding selection, they're adding new features like grocery there, adding to their Prime benefits, and a lot of the work that we do in the United States carries over there. The second group is the emerging countries. And, of course, we've launched 10 new countries in the last seven years. Each of those has its own particular trajectory on profitability. The first thing we see there is having a good customer experience, having people sign up for Prime. A lot of times, our Prime Video benefits help with that. Then work on our cost structure as we get scale, ad advertising and other things. And eventually, what we see is a break-even countries breakeven and then they make positive income and free cash flow and are more of a contribution to the -- positive contribution to the international segment. So, we're seeing both the emerging and the established improving, and we like the trajectory. And I think you'll see more of as we move forward.",neutral,0.785748303,Neutral,Slightly Positive,0.2,0.4,0.3,0.1,0,Slightly Positive
Q1_2024,Andy Jassy,Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah. I would add a few things. I mean, I'm again quite bullish on our international stores business. It's already a very large business. We've added a number of countries that are on the right trajectory, as Brian just indicated, and it's going to be a big, profitable business for us. And I really like the direction it's headed. I'll take also just the second part of your question just really around continuing to take -- to work on cost structure. I'd say first of all, on the regionalization side, which we've talked a lot about the last year, it may sound a little boring to talk about because we talked about it a lot of times. But I'd just tell you that we're not done there. A lot of the work that we've done, we still have opportunities to refine to get more value out of that. And a lot of what we learned on the regionalization side in the US was in part inspired from what we saw in Europe, which, in many ways, is set up as a regional network because of the nature of how close those countries are to one another. And I would say, we have also learned lessons from what we've done in the US that we're going to be able to apply to our international operations as well. I think we see additional opportunities in all sorts of places. A good example, of which is just how and where we inbound items to. The architecture we've had set up has largely had people inbounding to a couple of places. And then we spent a lot of effort and time and expense in breaking those down and shipping them to lots of other places. And we believe we're going to be much more efficient in how we use the inbound network and how we partner with our sellers. Part of what we did with our change in seller fees, we lowered the outbound fees in a meaningful way, but then we added an incentive for our sellers to inbound into locations that allow us to be more cost following and allow both our sellers and us to enjoy in those cost savings when we're able to do so. And we're seeing very optimistic signs there, too. I think we're still early with respect to how we can continue to optimize the number of units per box, which has all sorts of good benefits. And then I'd just also say that it's been really interesting to watch the same-day facilities evolution in our fulfillment network. And I think a lot of people have made the assumption over the last few years that faster speeds are going to mean higher cost, and that is not the case if you build the infrastructure with the right building blocks the way we have over the last couple of years. And our same-day facilities are our least expensive facilities in the network. We still have a fraction of the number of those that we will have in the US that we'll have in other parts of the world, which will, again, both change our cost structure while increasing speed. So, I don't think we're at the limits of what we can do. It's not going to all happen in one year. We're going to be working hard at this and inventing at this for several years, but I think we have a lot of upside in front of us.",neutral,0.854581535,Neutral,Slightly Positive,0.2,0.4,0.3,0.1,0,Slightly Positive

Q2_2024,Andrew R. Jassy,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Thanks, Dave. Today, we're reporting $148 billion in revenue, up 11% year over year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates. Operating income was $14.7 billion, up 91% year over year, and trailing 12-month free cash flow adjusted for equipment finance leases was $51.4 billion, up 664% or $44.7 billion year over year. As I think about what matters to customers long term and therefore to Amazon, there's a lot to like about what we're seeing. Starting with AWS, year-over-year revenue growth accelerated again from 17.2% in Q1 to 18.8% in Q2. We're continuing to see three macro trends drive AWS growth. First, companies have completed the significant majority of their cost optimization efforts and are focused again on new efforts. Second, companies are spending their energy again on modernizing their infrastructure and moving from on-premise infrastructure to the cloud. This modernization enables builders to save money, innovate at a more rapid clip, and drive productivity in most companies' scarcest resource developers. This is the flip I've talked about in the past, where the vast majority of global IT spend today is on-premises, and we expect that to keep inverting over time. With the broadest functionality, the strongest security, and operational performance, and the deepest partner ecosystem, AWS continues to be the customer's partner of choice and the biggest beneficiary of this split from on-premises to the cloud. And third, builders and companies of all sizes are excited about leveraging AI. Our AI business continues to grow dramatically with a multibillion-dollar revenue run rate despite it being such early days. but we can see in our results and conversations with customers that our unique approach and offerings are resonating with customers. At the heart of this strategy is a firmly held belief which we've had since the beginning of AWS that there is not one tool to rule the world. People don't want just one database option or one analytics choice one container type. Developers and companies not only reject it, but are suspicious of it. They want multiple options for flexibility and to use the best tool for each job to be done. The same is true in AI. You saw this several years ago when some companies tried to argue that TensorFlow will be the only machine learning framework that mattered and then PyTorch and others overtook it. The same one model or one-chip approach dominated the earliest moments of the generative AI boom, but we have a lot of data that suggests this is not what customers want here either, and our AWS team is determined to deliver choice and options for customers. You can see this philosophy in the primitive building blocks we're building at all three layers of the GenAI stack. At the bottom layer, which is for those building generative AI models themselves, the cost of compute for training and inference is critical, especially as models get to scale. We have a deep partnership with NVIDIA and the broader selection of NVIDIA instances available, but we've heard loud and clear from customers that they relish better price performance. It's why we've invested in our own custom silicon in Trainium for training and Inferentia for inference. And the second versions of those chips with Trainium coming later this year are very compelling on price performance. We are seeing significant demand for these chips. These model builders also desire services that make it much easier to manage the data, construct the models, experiment, deploy to production, and achieve high-quality performance, all while saving considerable time and money. That's what Amazon SageMaker does so well. including its most recently launched feature called HyperPods, that changes the game and networking performance for large models, and we're increasingly seeing model builders standardized on SageMaker. While many teams will build their own models, lots of others will leverage somebody else's frontier model, customize it with their own data and seek a service that provides broad model selection and great generative AI capabilities. This is what we think of as the middle layer what Amazon Bedrock does and why Bedrock has tens of thousands of companies using it already. Bedrock has the largest selection of models, the best generative AI capabilities in critical areas like model valuation, guardrails, RAG, and agenting, and then makes it easy to switch between different model types and model sizes. Bedrock has recently added an Anthropic Claude 3.5 models, which are the best-performing models on the planet, Meta's new Llama 3.1 models and Mistral's new Large 2 models. And Llama's and Mistral's impressive performance benchmarks and open nature are quite compelling to our customers as well. At the application or top layer, we're continuing to see strong adoption of Amazon Q, the most capable generative AI-powered assistant for software development and to leverage your own data. Q has the highest known score and acceptance rate for code suggestions, but it does a lot more than provide code suggestions. It tests code, outperforms all other publicly benchmarked competitors in catching security vulnerabilities, and leads all software development assistance in connecting multiple steps together and applying automatic action. It also saves development team's time and money on the muck nobody likes to talk about. For instance, when companies decide to upgrade from one version of a framework to another, it takes development teams many months, sometimes years burning valuable opportunity costs and churning developers who hate this tedious though important work. With Q's code transformation capabilities, Amazon has migrated over 30,000 Java JDK applications in a few months, saving the company $260 million and 4,500 developer years compared to what it would have otherwise cost That's the game changer. And think about how this Q transformation capability might evolve to address other elusive but highly desired migrations. During the past 18 months, AWS has launched more than twice as many machine learning and generative AI features into general availability than all of the other major cloud providers combined. This team is cooking, but we're not close to being done adding capabilities for our customers' interface. For perspective, we've added over $2 billion in advertising revenue year over year and generated more than $50 billion in revenue in the trailing 12 months. Sponsored ads drive the majority of our advertising revenue today, and we see further opportunity there. Even with this growth, it's important to realize we're at the very beginning of what's possible in our video advertising. In May, we made our first appearance at the upfronts, and we're encouraged by the agency and advertiser feedback on the differentiated value we offer across our content, reach, signals, and ad tech. With ads and Prime Video, the exciting opportunity for brands is the ability to directly connect advertising has traditionally been focused on driving awareness, as is the case for TV, to a business outcome like product sales or subscription sign-ups. We're able to do that through our measurement and ad tech, so brands can continually improve the relevance and performance of their ads. While ads have become a norm of streaming video, we aim to have meaningfully fewer ads than linear TV and other streaming TV providers. And of course, for customers preferring an ad-free experience, we offer that option for an additional $2.99 a month. In our stores business, we saw growth of 9% year over year in the North America segment and 10% year over year in the international segment. A few notes on our North America revenue growth rate. First, last quarter's leap day added about 100 basis points of year-over-year growth. Second, we're seeing lower average selling prices or ASPs right now because customers continue to trade down on price when they can more discretionary higher ticket items like computers or electronics or TVs are growing faster for us than what we see elsewhere in the industry, but more slowly than we see in a more robust economy and our continued faster delivery speed is earning us more of our customers' everyday essentials business. Third, our seller fees are a little lower than expected given the behavior changes we've seen from our latest fee changes. While some of these issues compress short-term revenue, we generally like these trends. While consumers are being careful on price, our North American unit growth is meaningfully outpacing our sales growth, as our continued work on selection, low prices and delivery is resonating. So, far this year, our speed of delivery for Prime customers has been faster than ever before, with more than 5 billion units arriving the same day or next day. As more customers experience our fast delivery, they look to Amazon for more of their shopping needs, and the continued acceleration of our everyday essentials business as an example of this phenomenon. On seller fees, lowering apparel fees has spurred substantial year-over-year unit growth in apparel and the incentive we've given sellers to send their items to multiple Amazon inbound facilities so they can save money where they save us effort and money is getting more traction than we'd even hoped. These collective developments will benefit customers in the form of better selection, lower prices, and faster delivery speed. There's no shortage of ideas aimed at improving the experience for stores customers. For instance, we're adding even more value to Prime, recently introducing free restaurant delivery in many of our geos expanding Amazon's pharmacy RxPass Medicare members. This is a benefit that gives subscribers all-you-can-consume access to the most common generic medications for just $5 a month, and offering a grocery subscription to help save on grocery items when shopping our U.S. and U.K. fresh stores. As we pursue these initiatives, we remain focused on lowering our cost to serve. We have a number of opportunities to further reduce costs, including expanding our use of automation and robotics, further building out our same-day facility network, and regionalizing our inbound network. With more optimal inbound inventory placement, we expect to enable faster speeds, consolidate more orders in one box, and reduce inventory transfers once items reach a fulfillment center. These cost improvements won't happen in one quarter or one fell swoop. They take technology and process innovation with a lot of outstanding execution, but we see a path to continuing to lower our cost to serve, which as we've discussed in the past, has very meaningful value for customers in our business. As we lower our cost to serve, we can add more low ASP selection that we can support economically which, coupled with our fast delivery puts Amazon in the consideration set for increasingly more shopping needs for customers. A few other comments about areas in which we're investing. We remain very bullish on the medium to long-term impact of AI in every business we know and can imagine. The progress may not be one straight line for companies. Generative AI, especially, is quite iterative and companies have to build muscle around the best way to solve actual customer problems. But we see so much potential to change customer experiences. We see in how our generative AI-powered shopping assistant, Rufus, is helping customers make better shopping decisions. We see it in how our AI features that allow customers to simulate trying apparel items or changing the buying experience. We see it in how our generative AI listing tools enabling sellers to create new selection with the line or two of text versus the many forms previously required. We see it in our fulfillment centers across North America, where we're rolling out Project Private Investigator, which uses a combination of generative AI and computer vision to uncover defects before products reach customers. We see it in how our generative AI is helping our customers discover new music and video. We see it in how it's making Alexa smarter, and we see it in how our custom silicon and services like SageMaker and Bedrock are helping both our internal teams and many thousands of external companies reinvent their customer experiences and businesses. We are investing a lot across the board in AI, and we'll keep doing so as we like what we're seeing and what we see ahead of us. We also continue to like the progress in Prime Video. Our storytelling is resonating with our hundreds of millions of monthly viewers worldwide. In the 62th Emmy nominations, Amazon MGM Studios recently received it's another supporting data point. We recently debuted titles like Fallout, the second most-watched original title ever for Prime Video. The Idea of You, which attracted nearly 50 million viewers worldwide in the first two weeks on Prime Video, and Season 4 of The Boys, which reached No. 1 on Prime Video in 165 countries in its opening two weeks, and we continue to see momentum in live sports. We recently announced 11-year landmark deals with the NBA and the WNBA. When combined with our original films and shows, partnered streaming services, licensed content, and rent or buy titles, Prime Video continues to evolve into the best destination for streaming video. And for Project Kuiper, our low Earth orbit satellite constellation, we're accelerating satellite manufacturing in our facility at Kirkland, Washington. We've announced a distribution agreement with VRIO who distributes DIRECTV Latin America and Sky Brazil to offer Project Kuiper satellite broadband network to residential customers across seven countries in South America and we continue to see field significant demand for the service from enterprise and government entities. We expect to start shipping production satellites late this year and continue to believe this could be a very large business for us. I could go on, but we'll stop here. There's a lot to feel optimistic about over the next several years, and the team collectively remains focused on continuing to invent and deliver for our customers in the business. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian for a financial update.",neutral,0.836464584,Neutral,Slightly Positive,0.2,0.4,0.3,0.1,0,Slightly Positive
Q2_2024,Brian T. Olsavsky,"Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Andy. Let's start with our top-line financial results. Worldwide revenue was $148 billion, an 11% increase year over year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. This equates to a $1 billion headwind from foreign exchange in the quarter, which is about $300 million higher than we had anticipated in our Q2 guidance range. Worldwide operating income nearly doubled year over year to $14.7 billion, which was $700 million above the high end of our guidance range. Across all of our segments, we remain focused on managing costs in a way that allows us to continue innovating and investing in areas that we think can move the needle for our customers. Starting with the North America and international segments. Customers continue to respond positively to our focus on low prices, broad selection, and fast shipping offers. We delivered our fastest speeds ever so far this year, which helps drive strength in areas like our everyday essentials. These include items like nonperishable foods, as well as health, beauty, and personal care items and Prime members continue to increase their shopping frequency while growing their spend on Amazon. Overall unit sales grew 11% year over year, which is consistent with our growth rates in Q1 after you adjust for the approximately 100 basis point impact of leap year. North America segment revenue was $90 billion, an increase of 9% year over year, and international segment revenue was $31.7 billion, an increase of 10% year over year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. North America segment operating income was $5.1 billion, an increase of $1.9 billion year over year. Operating margin was 5.6%, up 170 basis points year over year and down 20 basis points quarter over quarter. If we look at profitability of the core North America stores business, we actually improved our margin again quarter over quarter in Q2. The overall North America segment operating margin decreased slightly due to increased Q2 spend in some of our investment areas, including Kuiper, where we're starting to manufacture satellites will launch in the space in Q4. We saw improvements in our cost to serve driven by our efforts to place inventory more regionally, closer to where our customers are. This resulted in more consolidated shipments with higher units per box shipped. We also saw packages traveling shorter distances to customers, and this also led to better on-road productivity in our transportation network. Our international segment was profitable again in Q2, with operating income of $300 million, an improvement of $1.2 billion year over year. Operating margin was 0.9%, up 390 basis points year over year. This increase is primarily driven by our established countries as we improve our cost structure with a better inventory placement and more consolidated shipments. Additionally, our emerging countries continued to expand their customer offerings, leverage their cost structure, and invest in expanding Prime benefits. We are pleased with the overall progress of these countries as they make strides on their respective paths to profitability. Advertising remains an important contributor to profitability in the North America and international segments. And we saw strong growth on an increasingly larger revenue base this quarter. We continue to see opportunities to further expand our offering in areas that are driving growth today like sponsored products, as well as newer areas like Prime Video ads. Moving next to our AWS segment. Revenue was $26.3 billion, an increase of 18.8% year over year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. AWS now is an annualized revenue run rate of more than $105 billion. During the second quarter, we saw continued growth across both generative AI and non-generative AI workloads. We saw companies turn their attention to newer initiatives, bring more workloads to the cloud, restart or accelerate existing migrations from on-premises to the cloud, and tap into the power of generative AI. AWS operating income was $9.3 billion, an increase of $4 billion year over year. It's driven by our continued focus on cost control, including the measured pace of hiring. Additionally, AWS operating margin includes an approximately 200 basis points favorable impact from the change in the estimated useful life of our servers that we instituted in Q1. As we've long said, we expect AWS operating margins to fluctuate over time, driven in part by the level of investments we're making at any point in time. We remain focused on driving efficiencies across the business, which enables us to invest to support the strong growth we're seeing in AWS, including generative AI. Now let's turn our attention to capital investments. As a reminder, we define these as a combination of capex plus equipment finance leases. For the first half of the year, capex was $30.5 billion. Looking ahead to the rest of 2024, we expect capital investments to be higher in the second half of the year. The majority of the spend will be to support the growing need for AWS infrastructure as we continue to see strong demand in both generative AI and our non-generative AI workloads. For the third quarter, specifically, I'd highlight a few seasonal factors to keep in mind. First, we hosted another successful Prime Day in mid-July. It was our 10th Prime Day and was our largest ever. Prime members globally saved billions of dollars on deals across every product category. From a profitability perspective, we've historically seen a headwind to operating margin in Q3 and driven by Prime Day deals, as well as the marketing spend surrounding the event. Additionally, in Q3, we also began to ramp up our capacity to handle Q4 holiday volumes in our fulfillment network. And lastly, we expect an increase in digital content costs quarter over quarter from the return of our NFL Thursday Night Football. We remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience, who believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for our shareholders. With that, let's move on to your questions. Operator At this time, we will now open the call up for questions. We ask each caller to please limit yourself to one question.

Q2_2024,Eric Sheridan,Analyst,"Thanks so much for taking the question and thanks for all the detail in the prepared remarks. Maybe a two-parter on AWS. There's been a theme during the last couple of weeks of earnings of the potential to overinvest as opposed to underinvest in AI as a broad team. I'm curious, Andy, if you have a perspective on that in terms of thinking about elements of capitalizing on the theme longer term against the potential for basic cadence of investment by the AWS as a segment? And the second part would be coming back to your comments on custom silicon. How do you feel about custom silicon both from a pace of investment? And then more broadly, how you think about it as a return profile on a pivot to more custom silicon in your portfolio over the medium to long term? Thanks so much.",neutral,0.907742858,Neutral,Neutral,0.1,0.2,0.5,0.1,0.1,Neutral
Q2_2024,Andrew R. Jassy,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Thanks, Eric. I'll take them in order. I think on the question about investment in AWS and on the AI side, I think where I'd start is, I think one of the least understood parts about AWS over the last 18 years has been what a massive logistics challenge it is to run that business. If you think about the fact that we have about 35 regions and think of a region as a cluster of multiple data centers and about 110 availability zones, which is roughly equivalent to a data center, sometimes it includes multiple. And then if you think about having to land thousands and thousands of SKUs across the 200 AWS services in each of those availability zones at the right quantities, it's quite difficult. And if you end up actually with too little capacity, then you have service disruptions, which really nobody does because it means companies can't scale their applications. So most companies deliver more capacity than they need. However, if you actually deliver too much capacity, the economics are pretty woeful and you don't like the returns of the operating income. And I think you can tell from having -- we disclosed both our revenue and our operating income in AWS that we've learned over time to manage this reasonably well. And we have built models over a long period of time that are algorithmic and sophisticated that land the right amount of capacity. And we've done the same thing on the AI side. Now AI is newer. And it's true that people take down clumps of capacity in AI that are different sometimes. But it's also true that it's not like a company shows up to do a training cluster asking for a few hundred thousand chips the same day. Like you have a very significant advanced signal when you have customers that want to take down a lot of capacity. So, while the models are more fluid, it's also true that we've built, I think, a lot of muscle and skill over time in building these capacity signals and models, and we also are getting a lot of signal from customers on what they need. I think that the reality right now is that while we're investing a significant amount in the AI space and in infrastructure, we would like to have more capacity than we already have today. I mean we have a lot of demand right now. And I think it's going to be a very, very large business for us. On the custom silicon point, it's really interesting what's happened here. And our strategy and approach here has been informed by running AWS for 18 years. When we started AWS, we had and still have a very deep partnership with Intel on the generalized CPU space. But what we found from customers is that they -- when you find an offering that is really high value for you and high return, you don't actually spend less, even though you're spending less per unit, you spend less per unit, but it enables you and frees you up to do so much more inventing and building for your customers. And then when you're spending more, you actually want better price performance than what you're getting. And a lot of times, it's hard to get that price performance from existing players unless you decide to optimize yourself for what you're learning from your customers and you push that envelope yourself. And so, we built custom silicon in the generalized CPU space with Graviton, which we're on our fourth model right now. And that has been very successful for customers and for our AWS businesses, that saves customers up to about 30% to 40% price performance versus the other leading x86 processors that they could use. And we saw the same trend happening about five years ago in the accelerator space in the GPU space, where the products are good, but there was really primarily one provider and supply was more scarce than what people wanted. And our customers really want improved price performance all the time. And so, that's why we went about building Trainium, which is our training chip, and Inferentia, which is our inference chip, which we're on second versions of both of those, they will have very compelling relative price performance and in a world where it's hard to get GPUs today, the supply is scarce and all the schedules continue to move over time. customers are quite excited and demanding at a high clip. Our custom silicon, and we're producing it as fast as we can. I think that's going to have very good return profile just like Graviton has and I think it will be another differentiating feature around AWS relative to others. Operator And our next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.",neutral,0.945388794,Neutral,Slightly Positive,0.2,0.4,0.3,0.1,0,Neutral
Q2_2024,Brian Nowak,Analyst,"Thanks for taking my questions. I have wo. So, the first one I wanted to ask about in the second quarter, the retail gross margins that we're trying to do the monkey math, look a little weaker than expected. Was there any extra pressure on retail gross margins because of discounting? Or is that where Kuiper is? Or sort of how do we think about some of the drivers of retail gross margins in the quarter of shipping? And the second one, Andy, in the past, you talked about cost-to-serve improvement and sort of getting the North America margins back to pre-pandemic levels. Can you just remind us again sort of the internal philosophy about executing on that? Is there a timeline to deliver on that? Sort of how are you sort of balancing showing that profitability improvement over the next couple of years versus pressing on new investments like Kuiper and perhaps reinvesting some of those profits over the next couple of years?",neutral,0.592805386,Neutral,Neutral,0.1,0.2,0.5,0.1,0.1,Neutral
Q2_2024,Brian T. Olsavsky,"Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, Brian, let me start with the first question on North America margins. So, if you look at the segment operating margins, we did decrease 20 basis points sequentially from Q1 to Q2. I'll remind you that we had to see the annual step-up in stock-based compensation at the end of Q1 each year, and that added about $1.8 billion of stock-based comp expense in Q2 versus Q1. So, that's impacting to some extent, all three segments. But even with that stock-based comp step up, the stores part of the North America segment, increase the margin again last quarter. So, we're continuing to see strong improvements in cost to serve, as well as improvement in speed, added selection, better safety. So, a lot of the key areas that we're hitting on are strong. What you're seeing for the segment is that some of our investment areas had a tick up in expenses and investment in Q2 versus Q1. And that's not unheard of. Q1 is usually the lightest investment quarter, things like Prime Video and devices have less investment going on in those quarters. But the one thing I'd point out, I think we mentioned it is Kuiper stepping up a bit in Q2 versus Q1. And as we start to build satellites that we'll launch in Q3 and Q4 this year.",positive,0.52520436,Slightly Positive,Neutral,0.1,0.2,0.5,0.1,0.1,Slightly Positive
Q2_2024,Andrew R. Jassy,President and Chief Executive Officer,"And your second question, Brian, I continue and the team continues to believe that we have the opportunity to expand the margin in our stores business. And as I've said on a number of the calls that we've done, it's not going to happen in one quarter, it's not going to happen in one fell swoop, it's going to take work over a long period of time. But I think that one of the silver linings, if you will, about a year and a half ago in the ricochet of the pandemic and all the growth that we had and the cost to serve challenges that we had was, it really forced us to reevaluate everything in the network. And really, even our most closely felt beliefs over a long period of time. And what it did was unveiled a number of opportunities that we believe we have to keep driving cost to serve down. And the first one that you've seen play out over the last year or so has been the regionalization of the U.S. network. And I think one thing to remember about that is that while it's had even bigger impact than maybe we theorized when we first architected it, we're still not done fully honing it. There's a lot of ways that we continue to optimize that U.S. regionalization that we think will continue to bear lower cost to serve. But at the same time, we found a number of other areas where we believe we can take our cost down while also improving the customer experience. One of the great things about regionalization was it not only took our costs to serve down, but it meaningfully changed the speed with which we're able to get items to customers. And so, we have a number of those other opportunities. Another example of that is regionalizing our inbound network, which is also going to lower our cost to serve and get items more close to end users and diminish the amount of time it takes to get them to customers. We have a number of things that we're working on that allow us to combine more units per box, which lowers our costs as well and a lot of customers like that better because it's better for the environment, having more units per box. So, I think we have a lot of opportunities to continue to take down our cost to serve. And strategically and philosophically, just two other things as you were alluding to that question. I think that from our perspective, as we're able to take cost to serve down, it means that we're able to afford to have more selection that we're able to offer to customers. And there are a lot of lower ASP items there, average selling price items, that we don't stock because they're not economic to stock with our current cost to serve. But as we work hard to make progress like we are on lowering our cost to serve, that allows us to add more selection. And we see this time in and time out when we add more selection, customers actually consider us for more of their purchases and spend more with us down the line. I think the other thing, too, I would tell you is that I don't see it as being binary in any way, nor have I really ever seen it this way in the history of the company. I've been here 27 years. But we don't think of it as we can either be investing or we can be working on trying to take our cost to serve down. We believe we can do both. If you think about the examples you gave, the stores business and the Kuiper business are -- they're just different people working on those businesses. So, our stores team is going to continue to work really hard on expanding selection and keeping prices low and speeding up our delivery times and driving our cost to serve down while our Kuiper team is working on how to figure out how to help the 400 million to 500 million households around the world who don't have broadband connectivity get that connectivity and allow them to do a lot of the things we take for granted today with broadband connectivity. So, they're not going to be binary. We're going to work on them both at the same time. Operator And our next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.",neutral,0.886271,Neutral,Slightly Positive,0.2,0.4,0.3,0.1,0,Neutral
Q2_2024,Mark Mahaney,Analyst,"OK, thanks. I'll ask two questions. AWS, those three factors that are causing that kind of acceleration in Q2 and recovery in growth rates from a year ago, those sound sustainable? Is there any reason that we shouldn't see sort of ongoing acceleration at some level through the back half of the year? And secondly, I just want to ask about a small segment of pharmacy. It seems to me like at least, anecdotally, I've seen you lean more into marketing for that and survey work suggests to us that there's kind of greater consumer interest in that. Just talk about where that business is for you? And is it at a point where you feel like you've moved beyond early adoption and are leaning into kind of getting more mass Amazon customer adoption? Thank you.",neutral,0.739432812,Neutral,Neutral,0.1,0.2,0.5,0.1,0.1,Neutral
Q2_2024,Andrew R. Jassy,President and Chief Executive Officer,"On the AWS question, it's always hard to predict what the growth rates are going to be, and it's a relatively large business at $105 billion revenue run rate at this point. But I do think that we have seen the lion's share of the cost optimization happen. And I also do believe that pre-pandemic, we were on this March where most companies are trying to figure out how to modernize their infrastructure, which really means moving from on-premises to the cloud because they can save money and invent that more quickly and get better developer productivity. And then the pandemic happened and people were in survival mode and then a difficult economy came and people are trying to save money. And we just see people going back to asking themselves, why aren't we taking this low-hanging fruit here. I mean it makes -- I don't want to run my own data centers. I can actually be more cost-effective and invent more quickly from my customers if I'm using the cloud. And AWS with just a lot more functionality, stronger operational performance and security, which really matters to customers as well and a deeper partner ecosystem continues to be the partner of choice as people are moving to the cloud. And I think the generative AI component is in its very early days. As I said, we kind of sometimes look at it and say that it's interesting that we have a multibillion-dollar revenue run rate already in AI, and it's so early. But if we look at the amount of demand that we have from customers right now, it's very significant. So, I think all three of those things have a chance and will likely continue over time. And we'll see where that growth rate nets out over the next number of years. I think the one other thing I would say about that, too, Mark, is the business today, as I mentioned, it's a $105 billion revenue run rate business, about 90% of the global IT spend is still on-premises. And if you believe that equation is going to flip, which I do, there's a lot of growth ahead of us in AWS as the leader in all those dimensions I mentioned. But I also think that generative AI itself and AI as a whole it's going to be really large. I mean it is not something that we originally factored when we were thinking about how large AWS could be and unlike the non-AI space, where you're basically taking all of this infrastructure that's been built on-premises over a long period of time and working with customers to help them migrate it to the cloud, which is a lot of work, by the way, in the generative AI space, it's going to get big fast and it's largely all going to be built from the get-go in the cloud, which allows the opportunity for those businesses to continue to grow. On the pharmacy side, I think you're right that you're seeing that business continue to grow and to get more resonance with customers. And I think it was always a relatively natural extension for us to build a pharmacy offering from our retail business. But I think a lot of what you see in the business has grown really quickly, a lot of what you've seen is that the work that the team has done on the customer experience over the last 18 months has really paid off. Customers love the customer experience of Amazon Pharmacy. And especially, by the way, when you think about the experience and the speed and ease with which you can order versus walking into a pharmacy in a physical store, if you walk into pharmacies in cities today, it's a pretty tough experience with how much is locked behind cabinets, where you have to press a button to get somebody to come out and open the cabinets for you and a lot of shop lifting going on in the stores. So, the combination of what's happening in the physical world and how much improved we've made our pharmacy experience is driving a lot of customer resonance and buying behavior. I think also you see us continuing to expand there. We expanded our RxPass package and program to Medicare members, that program allows customers and Prime members to be able to get up to 60 common medications for just $5 a month. And we continue to launch same-day delivery of medications to cities. We have them in eight cities, including Los Angeles and New York today with plans to expand to more than a dozen cities by the end of the year. So, we're seeing a lot of growth there, and we're very optimistic about it. Operator And our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies.

Q2_2024,Brent Thill,Analyst,"On AWS, I'm curious if you had a backlog number you could share for the quarter. And I guess, Andy, when you think about getting the data state ready, I know AI today is early, but when you see most of these companies are having to move to public cloud, are you seeing a step-up in return to workloads moving to get ready for this day to stay even if they're not ready to adopt AI?

Q2_2024,David Fildes,"Vice President, Investor Relations","This is Dave. I'll just start off just to give you the backlog figure. So, at the end of the second quarter, it was $156.6 billion.

Q2_2024,Andrew R. Jassy,President and Chief Executive Officer,"On the second part of your question, Brent, what I would say is that it's true in analytics, but it's even maybe more so true in AI, which is that it's quite difficult to be able to do AI effectively if your data is not organized in such a way that you can access that data and run the models on top of them and then build the application. So, when we work with customers, and this is true both when we work directly with customers, as well as when we work with systems integrator partners, everyone is in a hurry to get going on doing generative AI and one of the first questions that we ask is show us where your data is, show us what your data lake looks like, show us how you're going to access that data. And there's very often work associated with getting your data in the right shape and in the right spot to be able to do generative AI. Fortunately, because so many companies have done the work to move to the cloud, there's a number of companies who are ready to take advantage of AI, and that's where we've seen a lot of the growth. But also it's worth remembering that again, remember the 90% of the global IT spend being on-premises, there are a lot of companies who have yet to move to a cloud, who will, and the ability to use AI more effectively is going to be one of the many drivers in doing so for them.

It's up from the mid-20% range last year. So, you're seeing the impact of a number of cost reductions that we've made and efficiencies we've driven in the business. There's also an adjustment that we made to the useful life of servers that happened in Q1. Talked about last quarter, that contributed about 200 basis points of margin year over year. So, we continue to work on the cost structure. But again, as we've said in the past, these operating margin will fluctuate and be lumpy quarter to quarter.

Q2_2024,David Fildes,"Vice President, Investor Relations","Yeah, this is Dave. Just real quick on that. You mentioned we're about $300 million profit for the quarter. That is up about 390 basis points year on year from a margin perspective. And as we talked about in the past, there's a number of countries that different stages of existence and maturity there. And so, I think you're seeing continued progress, certainly on a year-over-year basis with both our established countries. So, the U.K., Germany and Japan in particular, being sizable contributors to that business, continued improvement and build out there, similar to the factors we talked about with the U.S., focused on operational efficiency while expanding the customer experience. And then in the emerging countries, as we've said over the past several quarters, we launched about 10 countries over the last seven years really focused on, again, expanding that customer experience, building out the Prime member benefits while building scalable solutions for customers. And so, I think in both that established and emerging areas, seeing good progress year over year in working for further improvement there.

Q2_2024,Brian T. Olsavsky,"Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, sure. Thank you, Doug. The macro factors, if I step back, I think Andy discussed it earlier as well. We're seeing a lot of the same consumer trends that we have been talking about for the last year. Consumers being careful with their spend, trading down, looking for lower ASP products, looking for deals. That continued into Q2, and we expect it to continue into Q3. We're seeing signs of it continuing in Q3. The difference in Q2 was that, again, we had very strong unit volume growth. We actually slightly accelerated when you adjust for leap year in North America unit growth in Q2. So, the drop in revenue sequentially -- revenue growth sequentially was tied to ASP and both continuation of existing trends, but also as we talked about growth in our everyday essentials business and categories. So, while we think we are selling a number of higher ticket items, certainly and holding up well in the market itself, certainly not as strong as it's been in a normalized economy. And lower ASP products are more of the mix right now.

Q3_2024,Andrew R. Jassy,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Thanks, Dave. Today, we're reporting $158.9 billion in revenue, up 11% year over year excluding the impact from foreign exchange rates. Operating income was $17.4 billion, up 56% year over year, and trailing 12-month free cash flow adjusted for equipment finance leases was $46.1 billion, up 128% or $25.9 billion year over year. As always, we're focused on making our customers' lives better and easier and thinking long term with respect to how we can keep helping customers and build a successful business to outlast all of us. In our Stores business, we saw sales growth of 9% year over year in the North America segment and 12% year over year in the international segment. Our team continues to focus on the inputs that matter most to customers: really broad selection, low prices, fast and free delivery, and a range of compelling Prime member benefits, including our recent additions of unlimited grocery delivery from Whole Foods Market, Amazon Fresh, and local third-party grocery partners for $9.99 a month and fuel savings of $0.10 a gallon at BP Amoco and ampm stations in the U.S. At a time when consumers are being careful about how much they spend, we're continuing to lower prices and ship even more quickly, and we can see this resonating with customers as our unit growth continues to be strong and outpace even our revenue growth. In the last few months, we've hosted our largest and most successful Prime Day and Prime Big Deal Days ever and helped customers save over $5 billion across more than 50 million deals. And for the second year in a row, we are on track to deliver our fastest speeds ever for Prime members globally. We also continue to focus on lowering our cost to serve and are pursuing several initiatives that we believe will have meaningful long-term impact in this area. First, we continue to believe there are more gains on top of what we've captured thus far in outbound regionalization and getting more items closer to end consumers. As such, we're in the process of significantly changing the way we inbound items into our fulfillment network and subsequently spread them to our regional fulfillment nodes. In the last few months, we've made hundreds of changes to our U.S. inbound network and opened more than 15 inbound buildings. While still relatively early in this rearchitecture, we've already improved our ability to spread inventory across our fulfillment centers by 25% year over year, allowing us to have more of the requisite items in fulfillment centers closest to the customer so we can compile shipments and ship to customers even more quickly. As we scale and optimize this new design, we expect these changes will further improve inventory placement, offer faster delivery times, save transportation costs, and enable us to increase units shipped per box. Second, we continue to roll out same-day delivery facilities, which is not only the fastest way to get products to customers but also one of our lowest-cost ways to deliver. Over 40 million customers this past quarter have had their orders delivered for free with same-day delivery, an increase of more than 25% year over year. And third, we continue to innovate in robotics to speed delivery, lower cost to serve, and further improve safety in our fulfillment network. We recently launched our 12th-generation fulfillment center design with the first building launching in Shreveport, Louisiana. This is the first facility that incorporates our newest robotics inventions to simplify stowing, picking, packing, and shipping processes. Thus far, this new design reduces fulfillment processing time by up to 25%, increases the number of items we can offer for same-day or next-day delivery, and is expected to drive a 25% improvement in our cost to serve during peak within this next-generation facility. Though we believe we have more expansive automation and robotics than other retail peers, it's still early days in how much automation we expect in our fulfillment network. In advertising, we remain pleased with our progress, generating $14.3 billion of revenue in the quarter, 18.8% year-over-year growth. Our expansive reach, ability to service relevant offers to our customers, opportunity to engage customers from the top of the funnel to point of purchase, and leading capabilities around measuring outcomes at every touch point provide all types of brands with full-funnel advertising at scale. In Sponsored products, we're seeing meaningful growth on a very large base, and we see further opportunity in driving even better performance for advertisers by further improving the relevancy of the ads we show and by providing additional optimization controls. At the same time, some of our newer offerings are in their very early days. We're just entering our first broadcast season for Prime Video advertising, following a very strong showing at upfronts. And we're continuing to support brands of all sizes with our generative AI-powered creative tools across display, video, and audio, including our video generator that uses a single product image to curate custom AI-generated videos. While we're generating a lot of advertising revenue today, there remains considerable upside. AWS grew 19.1% year over year and now stands at a $110 billion annualized run rate. We've seen significant reacceleration of AWS growth for the last four quarters. With the broadest functionality, the strongest security and operational performance, and the deepest partner community, AWS continues to be a customer's partner of choice. There are signs of this in every part of AWS' business. We see more enterprises growing their footprint in the cloud, evidenced in part by recent customer deals with the ANZ Banking Group, Booking.com, Capital One, Fast Retailing, Itau Unibanco, National Australia Bank, Sony, T-Mobile, and Toyota. You can look at our partnership with NVIDIA called Project Ceiba, where NVIDIA has chosen AWS' infrastructure for its R&D supercomputer due in part to AWS' leading operational performance and security. And you can see how AWS continues to innovate in its infrastructure capabilities. With deliveries like Aurora database, which extends AWS' very successful relational database to support millions of database writes per second and manage petabytes of data while maintaining the simplicity of operating a single database, or with our custom Graviton4 CPU instances, which provide up to nearly 40% better price performance versus other leading x86 processors. Companies are focused on new efforts again, spending energy on modernizing their infrastructure from on-premises to the cloud. This modernization enables companies to save money, innovate more quickly, and get more productivity from their scarce engineering resources. However, it also allows them to organize their data in the right architecture and environment to do generative AI at scale. It's much harder to be successful and competitive in generative AI if your data is not in the cloud. The AWS team continues to make rapid progress in delivering AI capabilities for customers in building a substantial AI business. In the last 18 months, AWS has released nearly twice as many machine learning and gen AI features as the other leading cloud providers combined. AWS's AI business is a multibillion-dollar revenue run rate business that continues to grow at a triple-digit year-over-year percentage and is growing more than three times faster at this stage of its evolution as AWS itself grew, and we felt like AWS grew pretty quickly. We talk about our AI offering as three macro layers of the stack, with each layer being a giant opportunity and each is progressing rapidly. At the bottom layer, which is for model builders, we were the first major cloud provider to offer NVIDIA's H200 GPUs through our EC2 P5 e-instances. And thanks to our networking innovations like Elastic Fabric adapter and Nitro, we continue to offer advantaged networking performance. And while we have a deep partnership with NVIDIA, we've also heard from customers that they want better price performance on their AI workloads. As customers approach higher scale in their implementations, they realize quickly that AI can get costly. It's why we've invested in our own custom silicon in Trainium for training and Inferentia for inference. The second version of Trainium, Trainium2 is starting to ramp up in the next few weeks and will be very compelling for customers on price performance. We're seeing significant interest in these chips, and we've gone back to our manufacturing partners multiple times to produce much more than we'd originally planned. We also continue to see increasingly more model builders standardize an Amazon SageMaker, our service that makes it much easier to manage your AI data, build models, experiment, and deploy to production. This team continues to add features at a rapid clip punctuated by SageMaker's unique HyperPod capability, which automatically splits training workloads across more than 1,000 AI accelerators, prevents interruptions by periodically saving checkpoints, and automatically repairing faulty instances from their last saved checkpoint and saving training time by up to 40%. At the middle layer where teams want to leverage an existing foundation model customized with their data and then have features to deploy high-quality generative AI applications, Amazon Bedrock has the broadest selection of leading foundation models and most compelling modules for key capabilities like model evaluation, Guardrails, RAG, and agents. Recently, we've added Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet model, Meta's Llama 3.2 models, Mistral's Large 2 models, and multiple stability AI models. We also continue to see teams use multiple model types from different model providers and multiple model sizes in the same application. There's mock and orchestration required to make this happen. And part of what makes Bedrock so appealing to customers and why it has so much traction is that Bedrock makes this much easier. Customers have many other requests, access to even more models, making prompt management easier, further optimizing inference costs, and our Bedrock team is hard at work making this happen. At the application or top layer, we're continuing to see strong adoption of Amazon Q, the most capable generative AI-powered assistant for software development and to leverage your own data. Q has the highest reported code acceptance rates in the industry for multiline code suggestions. The team has added all sorts of capabilities in the last few months, but the very practical use case recently shared where Q Transform saved Amazon's teams $260 million and 4,500 developer years in migrating over 30,000 applications to new versions of the Java JDK as excited developers and prompted them to ask how else we could help them with tedious and painful transformations. Spend a few minutes reading developer forums about what they wish they could move away from, and you'll get an idea of what they want, expect more practical AI game changers from Q. We're also using generative AI pervasively across Amazon's other businesses with hundreds of apps in development or launched for consumers. We've expanded Rufus, our generative AI-powered expert shopping assistant to the U.K., India, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, and Canada. And in the U.S., we've added more personalization, the ability to better narrow customer intent, and real-time pricing and deal information. We've recently debuted AI Shopping Guides for consumers, which simplifies product research by using generative AI to pair key factors to consider in a product category with Amazon's wide selection, making it easier for customers to find the right product for their needs. For sellers, we've recently launched Project Amelia, an AI assistant that offers tailored business insights to boost productivity and drive seller growth. We continue to rearchitect the brain of Alexa with a new set of foundation models that we'll share with customers in the near future, and we're increasingly adding more AI into all of our devices. Take the new Kindle Scribe we just announced. The note-taking experience is much more powerful with the new built-in AI-powered notebook, which enables you to quickly summarize pages of notes into concise bullets in a script that can easily be shared. Speaking of Kindle products, we just launched a completely new Kindle lineup, the first time we've done a portfolio refresh of this size. Apart from the Scribe, it includes the first-ever color Kindle, the fastest Kindle Paperwhite ever, and a new pocket-sized Kindle. The early sales for these devices have significantly outperformed our expectations, and Kindle is having an excellent year with customers reading more than ever. We now have over 20 billion average monthly pages read on Kindle devices worldwide. There are so many things we're energized by right now, but we'll quickly mention one more, the progress we're making in improving customers' pharmacy experience. Brick-and-mortar pharmacies account for just over 90% of prescriptions dispensed in the U.S. that require customers to make trips to forlorn physical venues with much of the selection behind locked shelves, waiting lines for meds and only finding out about pricing at the point of purchase. The largest mail-order pharmacies offer delivery in 5 to 10 business days. We think customers deserve better. Today, we can deliver to 95% of first-time Amazon Pharmacy customers in the U.S. within two business days and to 20% of U.S. Prime members within 24 hours. Next year, we plan to launch operations in 20 new cities, so nearly half the U.S. will have the ability to have their medications delivered to their door within hours. We believe making it easier for customers to get their medications will improve medication adherence, which we know can directly improve health outcomes. Across Amazon, we have a lot coming in the next few months. We eagerly look forward to sharing these with customers, and a big thank you to my Amazon teammates around the world for all their hard work. And with that, I'll turn it over to Brian for a financial update.",positive,0.938641071,Strong Positive,Slightly Positive,0.2,0.4,0.3,0.1,0,Strong Positive
Q3_2024,Brian T. Olsavsky,"Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Andy. Let's start with our top-line financial results. Worldwide revenue was $158.9 billion, an 11% increase year over year, excluding a 20 basis point unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. As a reminder, our Q3 guidance had anticipated a larger unfavorable impact of approximately 90 basis points. Worldwide operating income increased 56% year over year to $17.4 billion, our highest quarterly operating income ever, and was $2.4 billion above the high end of our guidance range. We remain focused on streamlining and managing costs in a way that allows us to continue inventing for customers in a cost-effective way. In the third quarter, North America segment revenue was $95.5 billion, an increase of 9% year over year. International segment revenue was $35.9 billion, an increase of 12% year over year. Worldwide paid units accelerated to 12% growth year over year as our customers continue to come to Amazon for low prices, broad selection, and convenient fast delivery. Prime remains a core contributor to this growth. Year-over-year paid membership growth accelerated in Q3 from both the U.S. and globally, helped by our tenth annual Prime Day event in mid-July. Customers are enjoying even faster delivery speeds, which also helps drive strong growth in items like everyday essentials. This includes items like health, beauty, and personal care, as well as nonperishable grocery. And while these items often have a lower average selling price, the strength in everyday essential's revenue is a positive indicator that customers are turning to us for more of their daily needs. We see that when customers purchase these types of items from us, they build bigger baskets, shop more frequently, and spend more on Amazon. We remain focused on keeping prices sharp and offering broad selection that gives customers options when making purchase decisions. Shifting to profitability. Our North America and international segments each delivered their seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year operating margin improvement. North America segment operating income was $5.7 billion, an increase of $1.4 billion year over year. North America operating margin was 5.9%, up 100 basis points year over year. In the third quarter, we continue to make progress in improving our fulfillment network cost structure, driven in part by improved inventory placement. This helped us drive better productivity in our transportation network and shipping efficiency from higher units per box. In the international segment, operating income was $1.3 billion, an improvement of $1.4 billion year over year. International operating margin was 3.6%, up 390 basis points year over year. So, far this year, we've generated operating profit in each of the three quarters for the international segment and totals $2.5 billion year to date. We're seeing strength in our established countries like the U.K. and Germany as we continue to drive efficiencies to improve on-road productivity in our transportation network and better execution in our fulfillment centers. Our emerging countries are growing revenue at a healthy rate also, and they are leveraging their cost structures on investing strategically in Prime benefits. We have confidence that our focus on the inputs, coupled with the strength of our global teams, will continue to drive improvement over time. Advertising remains an important contributor to profitability in the North America and international segments. This quarter, we saw strong growth on an increasing large base of advertising revenue. We see many opportunities to further expand our ads offering in areas that are driving growth today like sponsored products, as well as more recent growth areas like Prime Video ads. Moving next to our AWS segment. Revenue was $27.5 billion, an increase of 19.1% year over year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. AWS now has an annualized revenue run rate of $110 billion. The business continues to grow and we see opportunity to expand our core cloud offering and our AI services. Customers increasingly recognize that to get the true benefit of generative AI, they also need to move to the cloud. AWS operating income was $10.4 billion, an increase of $3.5 billion year over year as a result of our continued focus on cost control, including a measured pace of hiring, a focus on driving efficiencies in our infrastructure, and reducing costs across the business. Additionally, we increased the estimated useful life of our servers starting in 2024, which contributed approximately 200 basis points to the AWS margin increase year over year in Q3. As we said in the past, we expect the AWS operating margins to fluctuate, driven in part by the level of investments we're making at any point in time. Now turning to our capital investments. As a reminder, we define these as a combination of cash capex plus equipment finance leases. Year-to-date capital investments were $51.9 billion. We expect to spend approximately $75 billion in capex in 2024. The majority of the spend is to support the growing need for technology infrastructure. This primarily relates to AWS as we invest to support demand for our AI services while also including technology infrastructure to support our North America and international segments. Additionally, we're continuing to invest in our fulfillment and transportation network to support the growth of the business, improve delivery speeds, and lower our cost to serve. This includes investments in same-day delivery facilities, in our inbound network, and as well in robotics and automation. We're encouraged by the start of the holiday season, which kicked off in October with a strong Prime Big Deal Days. We are ready to serve customers throughout the season, and I want to thank our teams across Amazon for delivering two very large Prime member events in the past four months and for getting us ready to delight customers during this holiday season. With that, let's move on to your questions. Operator Thank you. At this time, we will now open the call up for questions. We ask each caller to please limit yourself to one question.  Please hold while we poll for questions. Thank you. And the first question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question.",positive,0.955693483,Strong Positive,Slightly Positive,0.2,0.4,0.3,0.1,0,Strong Positive
Q3_2024,Doug Anmuth,Analyst,"Thanks so much for taking the questions. Brian, I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about the drivers of the 38% AWS margins. I know you mentioned the 200 basis points related to the useful lives pushout, but just how to think about sustainability kind of in the 30s there going forward? And then perhaps related, the step-up in capex that you saw in 3Q, you gave the full year number which was helpful. Any kind of early read or thoughts on how we should think about 2025? Thanks so much.",neutral,0.844116092,Neutral,Neutral,0.1,0.2,0.5,0.1,0.1,Neutral
Q3_2024,Brian T. Olsavsky,"Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","OK. Thanks, Doug. Let me start with AWS. Yes, the primary drivers of the year-over-year margin increase are threefold. So, first is accelerating top-line demand. That helps with all of our efficiencies, our cost control efforts. And of course, what you just mentioned, I believe the change in -- made the useful life of our servers this year. Let me remind you on that one. We made the change in 2024 to extend the useful life of our servers. This added about 200 basis points of margin year over year. On cost control, there's been a number of areas. First is hiring and staffing. We're very measured in our hiring, as you can tell, as a company where our office staff is down slightly year over year and it's flat to the end of last year. So, we're really working hard to maintain our efficiencies not only in the sales force and other areas and production teams but also in our infrastructure areas. Infrastructure is a big part of our cost structure in AWS, and we're probably the best at matching up supply and demand and driving cost efficiencies, and driving those operations very strongly. I think you saw that this quarter, especially on the higher volume. Over time, this margin will fluctuate in segment. There's a number of factors to keep in mind, including our level of investment and the amount of innovation and product development we're doing for new products and services, changes in our staffing for sales and support organizations, and, of course, capital to support customer growth and to build cost performance chips for our customers' applications. And as I mentioned, we do have a really good job in matching supply and demand, and we do that in this business. It can result in quarters that we just saw.",neutral,0.366467565,Neutral,Slightly Positive,0.2,0.4,0.3,0.1,0,Neutral
Q3_2024,Andrew R. Jassy,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah, I'll take the capex part of that. As Brian said in his opening comments, we expect to spend about $75 billion in 2024. I suspect we'll spend more on that in 2025. And the majority of it is for AWS and specifically, the increased bumps here are really driven by generative AI. As I was mentioning in my opening comments, our AI business is a multibillion-dollar business that's growing triple-digit percentages year over year and is growing three times faster at its stage of evolution than AWS did itself. We thought AWS grew pretty fast. And so, the thing to remember about the AWS business is the cash life cycle is such that the faster we grow demand, the faster we have to invest capital in data centers and networking gear and hardware. And of course, in the hardware of AI, the accelerators or the chips are more expensive than the CPU hardware. And so, we invest in all of that upfront in advance of when we can monetize it with customers using the resources. But of course, a lot of these assets are many-year useful life assets. Data centers, for instance, are useful assets for 20 to 30 years. And so, I think we've proven over time that we can drive enough operating income and free cash flow to make this very successful return on invested capital business. And we expect the same thing will happen here with generative AI. It is a really unusually large, maybe once-in-a-lifetime type of opportunity. And I think our customers, the business, and our shareholders will feel good about this long term that we're aggressively pursuing it. Operator And our next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.",neutral,0.898239851,Neutral,Slightly Positive,0.2,0.4,0.3,0.1,0,Slightly Positive
Q3_2024,Ross Sandler,Analyst,"Andy, if I could push on that last answer, you talked about how AI is about the same size but growing way faster than early AWS. And if we look back at the market in like the early 2010s, it was hypercompetitive on pricing. Your margins were below 15%, I believe, back then. And it seems like a lot of that is what's going on right now in AI with these new AI data centers where you've got competitive pricing and suboptimal utilization just in the whole industry. So, as that revenue line grows from where it is today to tens of billions of dollars in coming years, how does that margin come on from the AI data centers versus your existing kind of 30-plus percent margin at AWS? Any thoughts on how quickly you can close the gap and how that looks on the new AI workloads versus maybe this mid-30s that the core business is running at? Thank you very much.",neutral,0.851991177,Neutral,Neutral,0.1,0.2,0.5,0.1,0.1,Neutral
Q3_2024,Andrew R. Jassy,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Yes. So, some quick context, Ross. I think one of the least understood parts about AWS, over time, is that it is a massive logistics challenge. If you think about, we have 35 or so regions around the world, which is an area of the world where we have multiple data centers, and then probably about 130 availability zone to data centers, and then we have thousands of SKUs we have to land in all those facilities. And if you land too little of them, you end up with shortages, which end up in outages for customers. So, most don't end up with too little, they end up with too much. And if you end up with too much, the economics are woefully inefficient. And I think you can see from our economics that we've done a pretty good job over time at managing those types of logistics and capacity. And it's meant that we've had to develop very sophisticated models in anticipating how much capacity we need, where, in which SKUs and units. And so, I think that the AI space is, for sure, earlier stage, more fluid and dynamic than our non-AI part of AWS. But it's also true that people aren't showing up for 30,000 chips in a day. They're planning in advance. So, we have very significant demand signals giving us an idea about how much we need. And I think that one of the differences if you were able to get inside of the economics of the different types of providers here is how well they manage that utilization and that capacity. It has a very direct impact on what kind of margins you have over time and what kind of capital efficiency you also have over time. And so, I think you're right, Ross, that there are some similarities in the early days here of AI, where the offerings are new and people are very excited about it. It's moving very quickly and the margins are lower than what they -- I think they will be over time. The same was true with AWS. If you looked at our margins around the time you were citing, in 2010, they were pretty different than they are now. I think as the market matures over time, there are going to be very healthy margins here in the generative AI space. Operator And the next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.",neutral,0.94500351,Neutral,Slightly Positive,0.2,0.4,0.3,0.1,0,Neutral
Q3_2024,Brian Nowak,Analyst,"Thanks for taking my questions. Hey, Andy. I have two. The first one, I feel like we talk a lot about your targets and sort of North Stars for domestic profitability. Can you talk to us a little bit about how you think about the drivers of international retail profitability from here and sort of how you think conceptually where the margins could go and what drives them there? And then the second one, I wanted to sort of ask you more about the robotics that you mentioned. I know you've been investing in robotics now for quite a few years. Where are you now in that journey? And how do we think about the next largest areas of investment in robotics in the warehouse network? Thanks.",neutral,0.919460237,Neutral,Neutral,0.1,0.2,0.5,0.1,0.1,Neutral
Q3_2024,Brian T. Olsavsky,"Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Thanks. This is Brian. Let me take the first part of that question on international segment profitability. So, if you've looked at the trends, we see quarter-to-quarter fluctuations certainly in operating profit in the international segment. But we're starting to see clear trend lines that are moving positive and above zero. And for each of the last seven quarters, as I mentioned, we've had year-over-year improvement in op margin. And in the last quarter, operating income was up $1.4 billion versus the prior year. So, really, it is a lot of the same factors you're seeing in North America, lower cost to serve, greater contribution from advertising, improved selection, faster delivery speeds, which help drive consumer demand. And if you step back further, international is really a mix of our established countries where we've been operating for a long time, the U.K., Europe, and Germany -- excuse me, Europe and Japan, and a number of emerging countries, including 10 new countries that we launched in the last seven years. So, there's a lot under the hood there and there's different stories in each country. Each of them is on a different point in the path from launching to customer adoption, just scaling toward profitability to then making consistent operating profit. So, I think our expectations in each of those countries mirror those in North America. And we intend, over the fullness of time, that we're going to aim for North America margins, which are not static themselves. So, we're happy with the performance. Glad to see a number above zero in many of the last few quarters, but really to the story on a country-by-country basis that we're working hard. On the robotics piece, what I would say is even though we believe we have more expansive and advanced automation, and robotics capabilities in our fulfillment network than other peers, it's so early with respect to what we're going to do automation, robotics-wise in our fulfillment network. We're just at the stage right now where we're starting to roll out. We had about a five or six very significant new robotics capabilities in the areas of stowing, picking, packing, and shipping that we are finally put into one facility to get the entire workflow. It's a facility in Shreveport, Louisiana that was just launched a few weeks ago. And as I mentioned in my opening comments, we're seeing very encouraging results there. And of course, the reason why we're trying to have more robotics and automation in our fulfillment network is it allows us to fast -- to ship more quickly, to ship more cost effectively, and to make conditions even safer for our fulfillment teammates than what they already have today. And I think something that the team has done in a very disciplined way, and I talked about this a little bit in my annual letter, my shareholder letter is just they have been very thoughtful about defining what are the primitive foundational building blocks that you need, that you can then use in lots of different combinations to build additional automation/robotics capabilities down the road that we can move even more quickly with the next generation of robotics capabilities? And that team has invested in those and they're already working on the next generation. And the last piece I would add to that is we really do believe that AI is going to be a big piece of what we do in our robotics network. We had a number of efforts going on there. We just hired a number of people from an incredibly strong robotics AI organization. And I think that will be a very central part of what we do moving forward, too. Operator And the next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs.

Q3_2024,Eric Sheridan,Analyst,"Thanks for taking the question. Maybe a two-part, if I can. Looking at the results in the commerce business, there's a clear sort of pattern emerging with respect to ASPs versus unit growth. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in terms of consumer behavior and the propensity to be receptive to either lower ASP items or discounts among consumer behavior? And then the second part would be, can you talk a little bit about some of the strategic initiatives you're building for the long term around capitalizing on lower ASP items and the potential shift to more consumables and the base of consumption habits on the platform? Thanks so much.",neutral,0.844890177,Neutral,Neutral,0.1,0.2,0.5,0.1,0.1,Neutral
Q3_2024,Andrew R. Jassy,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Eric, thank you for your question. Yes, you're right. Q3 unit volume was strong, 12% worldwide. It's pretty similar in North America versus international. And the consumer factors, we've seen a continuation of many of the things we've discussed over last few quarters. Customers looking for deals and are price conscious. This matches up well with our Prime events where we were -- which were well received and saved billions of dollars for our Prime members. It also led to Prime member -- paid Prime member growth accelerating in the quarter, which is hugely impactful for us. A lot of our best offers and deliveries are tuned to Prime membership, and it's the best deal in retail. So, with all the benefits you get for the subscription price, so those are all positive signs. When you look at the split between revenue growth and unit growth, you do see some impact of the lower ASP products that we're selling, as well as some of the trade down that consumers are doing. But we take that as a real positive, seeing the growth in everyday essential categories, which are really predicated on speed. So, you have to have fast delivery to be able to sell those products to customers. And when you do, it results in a stickier consumer relationship, higher orders, building larger baskets, which help our ship economics, and repeat orders are stronger. So, those are all positive signs, and we'll take any short-term degradation in ASP because what we're focused on primarily is free cash flow here. And we see the ability to unlock whole new elements of the consumer spend.",positive,0.836977124,Slightly Positive,Slightly Positive,0.2,0.4,0.3,0.1,0,Slightly Positive
Q3_2024,Brian T. Olsavsky,"Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","And I'll just add, Eric, on the lower ASP strategy. There's an expression that we've used a lot of times over the years that it's easy to lower prices but it's much harder to be able to afford to lower prices. And the same thing is probably true about lower ASP items. It's pretty easy to choose to supply them but it's much harder to be able to afford to economically supply them. And so, one of the reasons that we have been so maniacal about cost to serve over the last few years is that as we're able to take our cost to serve down, it just opens up the aperture for more items, particularly lower ASP items that we're able to supply in an economic way. And when you layer on top of that the broader selection, you layer on top of that faster speed and what we're able to do in getting items and fulfillment nodes local and close to our end customers, what we're able to do in expanding our same-day network, which allows us to ship same-day but also is one of our lowest-cost way to ship is it just lets us serve so many more of customers' shopping missions. And that's what we're seeing in our business right now. But again, I think there's a lot of opportunity to continue to expand that.

So, what we're seeing is still in a tight band between 59% and 61%. But what we're seeing is the impact of the everyday essentials. There's -- 3P demand is still strong and unit volumes are strong.

We've about 0.5 billion devices out there with a couple of hundred million active endpoints. And when we first were pursuing Alexa, we had this vision of it being the world's best personal assistant and people thought that was kind of a crazy idea. And I think if you look at what's happened in generative AI over the last couple of years, I think you're kind of missing the boat if you don't believe that's going to happen. It absolutely is going to happen. So, we have a really broad footprint where we believe if we rearchitect the brains of Alexa with next-generation foundational models, which we're in the process of doing, we have an opportunity to be the leader in that space. And I think if you look at a lot of the applications today that use generative AI, there's a large number of them that are having success in cost avoidance and productivity. And then you're increasingly seeing more applications have success in really impacting the customer experience and being really good at taking large corpuses of data and being able to summarize and aggregate and answer questions, but not that many yet that are really good on top of that in taking actions for customers. And I think that the next generation of these assistants and the generative AI applications will be better at not just answering questions and summarizing the indexing and aggregating data, but also taking actions. And you can imagine us being pretty good at that with Alexa. Operator And our final question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America.

Q3_2024,Justin Post,Analyst,"Great, thank you. Maybe a couple of questions. Just on the cloud, are you at all capacity constrained, and will the new Trainium or NVIDIA chips maybe even drive sales growth faster? And then secondly and I know there's been some competition from some of the more traditional retailers growing quickly online. Maybe talk about maybe the advantages that Amazon has with a fulfillment center distribution versus store distribution. Any thoughts on that? Thank you.",neutral,0.66774261,Neutral,Neutral,0.1,0.2,0.5,0.1,0.1,Neutral
Q3_2024,Andrew R. Jassy,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Well, on cloud, Justin, what I would tell you is that I believe we have more demand that we could fulfill if we had even more capacity today. I think pretty much everyone today has less capacity than they have demand for, and it's really primarily chips that are the area where companies could use more supply. And so, we're growing at a very rapid rate and have grown a pretty big business here in the AI space. and it's early days, but I actually believe that the rate of growth there has a chance to improve over time as we have bigger and bigger capacity. And I think that one of the reasons I mentioned in my opening comments that we have a very deep partnership with NVIDIA. We tend to be their lead partner on most of their new chips. We were the first to offer H200s in EC2 instances. And I expect us to have a partnership for a very long time that matters. It's also true that for customers that start to scale out their implementations on the inference side, particularly, they realize pretty quickly that it can get costly. And it's really why we have pursued building Trainium and Inferentia, which is our custom silicon. And the second version of Trainium, Trainium2 will start to ramp up in the next few weeks. And I think it's going to be very compelling for customers on a price-performance basis. And we have a lot of customer interest. We have gone back to our manufacturing partners a couple of times now to produce a lot more Trainium than we anticipated. Some of that, for sure, is due to the fact that we have very large demand, and we want more capacity and supply to be able to provide them. But a lot of it is that customers are excited about the price performance that they believe they're going to get in Trainium. So, I think it's a very significant opportunity for us in the AWS space, and it's going to be a very significant opportunity for customers. I think on the retail side, I'd start by just saying that we've always believed that competition is very positive and very healthy. It's good for consumers, good for businesses. It's actually great for innovation. And if you look at the retail space, it's a very, very large market segment. I mean, we have a pretty big retail business, and yet we're only about 1% of the market segment share of the worldwide global retail market segment. And still, about 80% to 85% of that market segment share lives in physical stores. And so, if you believe that equation is going to flip in the next 10 to 20 years, which we do, there's just a lot of opportunity not just for us but for several players. There won't be only one successful player. I do think that we have some elements of our customer experience that are really unusual and unlike others. I think we have meaningfully broader selection than almost all the players that you probably have seen and heard of. We have low prices with very significant deals that we go work with our third-party selling partners around key holiday shopping occasions. And then we have very significant advantages and speed of delivery to customers. And we just continue to see in every bit of testing and analysis that we do, that the faster that we're able to promise customers that we can get them their items, the more frequently they buy and the more they actually use Amazon for their shopping needs. And so, those are things that are pretty different. I also think we have a way of prioritizing customers that I think is unusual. Our orientation, our DNA, and our core at Amazon starts with the customer, and everything moves backwards from that. Any meeting you go to inside of Amazon, we're always asking ourselves what do customers want. What do customers say? What do they not like about the experience? What could be better? And that customer orientation is very important not just in how you take care of customers, but the world changes quickly all the time. And the technology is changing really quickly. And so, if you have the combination of strong technical aptitude, propensity, and a passion for inventing and then also a customer orientation where it drives everything you do, I think you have an opportunity to continue to build great trust in a business over a long period of time.",positive,0.676125824,Slightly Positive,Slightly Positive,0.2,0.4,0.3,0.1,0,Slightly Positive

Q4_2024,Andrew R. Jassy,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Thanks, Dave. Today, we're reporting $187.8 billion in revenue, up 10% year over year. Given the way the dollar strengthened throughout the quarter, we saw $700 million more of foreign exchange headwind than we anticipated in guidance. Without that headwind, revenue would have been 11% year over year and exceeded the top end of our guidance. Operating income was $21.2 billion, up 61% year over year, and trailing 12-month free cash flow adjusted for equipment finance leases was $36.2 billion, up $700 million year over year. We're pleased with the invention, customer experience improvements, and results delivered in 2024 and have a lot more planned in 2025. I'll start by talking about our stores business. We saw a 10% year-over-year revenue growth in our North America segment and 9% year over year in our international segment, excluding the impact from foreign exchange rates. Our continued focus on expanding selection, lowering prices, and improving convenience drove strong unit growth that even outpaced our revenue growth. We continue to add to our broad range of selection, giving customers choice across a variety of price points. We welcomed notable brands to our stores throughout 2024, including Clinique, Estee Lauder, Oura Rings, and Armani Beauty. We continue to add to the hundreds of millions of products offered from our selling partners who made up 61% of items that we sold in 2024, our highest annual mix of third-party seller units ever. We also launched Amazon Haul for U.S. customers in Q4, which offers customers an engaging shopping experience that brings ultra-low-priced products into one convenient destination. It's off to a very strong start. Customers continue to want Amazon to be the place they rely on for sharp pricing. In the fourth quarter, consumers saved more than $15 billion with our low everyday prices and record-setting events during the Prime Big Deal Days in October and Black Friday and Cyber Monday around Thanksgiving. Additionally, Profitero's annual pricing study found that entering the holiday season, Amazon had the lowest online prices for the eighth year in a row, averaging 14% lower prices on average than other leading retailers in the U.S. Our speed of delivery continues to accelerate, and 2024 was another record-setting year for Prime members. We expanded the number of same-day delivery sites by more than 60% in 2024, which now serve more than 140 metro areas. And overall, we delivered over 9 billion units the same or next day around the world. Our relentless pursuit of better selection, price and delivery speed is driving accelerated growth in Prime membership. For just $14.99 a month, Prime members get unlimited free shipping on 300 million items off of the same day or one-day delivery, exclusive shopping events like Prime Day, access to a vast collection of premium programming and live sports on Prime Video, ad-free listening of 100 million songs and podcasts with Amazon Music, access to unlimited generic prescription for only $5 a month, unlimited grocery delivery and orders over $35 from Whole Foods Market and Amazon Fresh for $9.99 a month, a free Grubhub Plus membership with free unlimited delivery, and our latest benefit of a $0.10 per gallon fuel discount at BP Amoco and Ampm stations. When you think about this as a whole and also compared to many other membership services that are comparably and more expensively priced that offer just one benefit like video, Prime is a screaming deal, and we have more coming for our Prime members in 2025. We also remain squarely focused on cost to serve in our fulfillment network, which has been a meaningful driver of our increased operating income. We've talked about the regionalization of our U.S. network. We've also recently rolled out our redesigned U.S. inbound network. While still in its early stages, our inbound efforts have improved our placement of inventory so that even more items are closer to end customers. Ahead of Black Friday in November, we'd improved the percentage of order units available in the ideal building by over 40% year over year. We've also spent considerable time optimizing the number of items we send customers in the same package, which reduces packaging, is more convenient for customers, and less expensive for us to fulfill. And our per-unit transportation costs continued to decline as we build out and optimize our last mile network. Overall, we've reduced our global cost to serve on a per unit basis for the second year in a row while at the same time increasing speed, improving safety and adding selection. As we look to 2025 and beyond, we see opportunity to reduce costs again as we further refine inventory placement, grow our same-day delivery network, and accelerate robotics and automation throughout the network. In advertising, we remain pleased with the strong growth on a very large base, generating $17.3 billion of revenue in the quarter and growing 18% year over year. That's a $69 billion annual revenue run rate, more than double what it was just four years ago at $29 billion. Sponsored products, the largest portion of ad revenue, are doing well and we see runway for even more growth. We also have a number of newer streaming offerings that are starting to become significant new revenue sources. On the streaming video side, we wrapped up our first year of Prime Video ads, and we're quite pleased with the early progress and headed into this year with momentum. We've made it easier to do full-funnel advertising with us. Full funnel is from the top of the funnel with broad reach advertising that drives brand awareness to mid-funnel sponsored brands let companies specify certain keywords and audiences to attract people to their detailed pages or brand store on Amazon, to bottom of the funnel, where sponsored products help advertisers service relevant product ads to customers at the point of purchase. We make this easy for brands to sign up for and deploy across our growing advertising. We also have differentiated audience features that leverage billions of customer signals across our stores and media destinations. From Amazon Marketing Cloud secure clean rooms providing advertisers the ability to analyze data, produce core marketing metrics, and understand how their marketing performs across various channels to our new multi-touch attribution model that helps advertisers understand how their marketing is working. If an advertiser uses streaming TV, display, sponsored products, and other ad types in their campaign, multi-touch attribution will show the relative contribution of each to their sales. Moving on to AWS. In Q4, AWS grew 19% year over year and now has a $115 billion annualized revenue run rate. AWS is a reasonably large business by most standards, and though we expect growth will be lumpy over the next few years as enterprise adoption cycles, capacity considerations, and technology advancements impact timing, it's hard to overstate how optimistic we are about what lies ahead for AWS' customers and business. I spent a fair bit of time thinking several years out. And while it may be hard for some to fathom a world where virtually every app has generative AI infused in it, with inference being a core building block just like compute, storage, and database, and most companies having their own agents that accomplish various tasks and interact with one another, this is the world we're thinking about all the time. And we continue to believe that this world will mostly be built on top of the cloud with the largest portion of it on AWS. To best help customers realize this future, you need powerful capabilities in all three layers of the stack. At the bottom layer for those building models, you need compelling chips. Chips are a key ingredient in the compute that drives training and inference. Most AI compute has been driven by NVIDIA chips, and we obviously have a deep partnership with NVIDIA and will for as long as we can see into the future. However, there aren't that many generative AI applications of large scale yet. And when you get there, as we have with apps like Alexa and Rufus, cost can get steep quickly. Customers want better price performance and it's why we built our own custom AI silicon. Trainium2 just launched at our AWS re:Invent Conference in December. And EC2 instances with these chips are typically 30% to 40% more price-performance than other current GPU-powered instances available. That's very compelling at scale. Several technically capable companies like Adobe, Databricks, poolside, and Qualcomm have seen impressive results in early testing of Trainium2. It's also why you're seeing Anthropic build their future frontier models on Trainium2. We're collaborating with Anthropic to build Project Rainier, a cluster of Trainium2 Ultra servers containing hundreds of thousands of Trainium2 chips. This cluster is going to be five times the number of exaflops as the cluster that Anthropic used to train their current leading set of cloud models. We're already hard at work on Trainium3, which we expect to preview late in '25, and defining Trainium4 thereafter. Building outstanding performant chips that deliver leading price performance has become a core strength of AWS', starting with our Nitro and Graviton chips in our core business and now extending to Trainium and AI and something unique to AWS relative to other competing cloud providers. The other key component for model builders is services that make it easier to construct their models. I won't spend a lot of time in these comments on Amazon SageMaker AI, which has become the go-to service for AI model builders to manage their AI data, build models, experiment, and deploy these models, except to say that SageMaker's HyperPod capability, which automatically splits trading workloads across many AI accelerators, prevents interruptions by periodically saving checkpoints, and automatically repairing faulty instances from their last saved checkpoint and saving training time by up to 40%. It continues to be a differentiator. Received several new compelling capabilities at re:Invent, including the ability to manage costs at a cluster level and prioritize which workloads should receive capacity when budgets are reached and is increasingly being adopted by model builders. At the middle layer, for those wanting to leverage frontier models to build gen AI apps, Amazon Bedrock is our fully managed service that offers the broadest choice of high-performing foundation models with the most compelling set of features and make it easy to build a high-quality generative AI application. We continue to iterate quickly on Bedrock announcing Luma AI and poolside and over 100 other popular emerging models to Bedrock at re:Invent. In short order, we also just added DeepSeek's R1 models to Bedrock and SageMaker. And additionally, we delivered several compelling new Bedrock features at re:Invent, including prompt caching, intelligent prompt routing and model distillation, all of which help customers achieve lower cost and latency in their inference. Like SageMaker AI, Bedrock is growing quickly and resonates strongly with customers. Related, we also just launched Amazon's own family of frontier models in Bedrock called Nova. These models compare favorably in intelligence against the leading models in the world but offer lower latency, lower price, about 75% lower than other models in Bedrock, and are integrated with key Bedrock features like fine-tuning, model distillation, knowledge bases of RAG and agentic capabilities. Thousands of AWS customers are already taking advantage of the capabilities and price performance of Amazon Nova models, including Palantir, Deloitte, SAP, Dentsu, Fortinet, Trellix, and Robinhood, and we've just gotten started. At the top layer of the stack, Amazon Q is the most capable generative AI-powered assistant for software development and to leverage your own data. You may remember that on the last call, I shared the very practical use case where Q transform helped save Amazon's teams $260 million and 4,500 developer years and migrating over 30,000 applications to new versions of the Java JDK. This is real value and companies asked for more, which we obliged with our recent deliveries of Q transformations that enable moves from Windows.NET applications to Linux, VMware to EC2, and accelerates mainframe migrations. Early customer testing indicates that Q was going to be a multiyear effort to do a mainframe migration into a multi-quarter effort, cutting by more than 50% the time to migrate mainframes. This is a big deal and these transformations are good examples of practical AI. While AI continues to be a compelling new driver in the business, we haven't lost our focus on core modernization of company's technology infrastructure from on-premises to the cloud. We signed new AWS agreements with companies, including Intuit, PayPal, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings, Northrop Grumman, the Guardian Life Insurance Company of America, Reddit, Japan Airlines, Baker Hughes, the Hertz Corporation, Redfin, Chime Financial, Asana, and many others. Consistent customer feedback from our recent AWS re:Invent gathering was appreciation that we're still inventing rapidly in non-AI key infrastructure areas like storage, compute, database, and analytics. Our functionality leadership continues to expand, and there were several key launches customers were abuzz about, including Amazon Aurora SQL, our new serverless distributed SQL database that enables applications with the highest availability, strong consistency, PostgreS compatibility, and four times faster reads and writes compared to other popular distributed SQL databases, Amazon S3 tables, which make S3 the first cloud object store with fully managed support for Apache Iceberg for faster analytics. Amazon S3 metadata, which automatically generates queryable metadata, simplifying data discovery, business analytics, and real-time inference to help customers unlock the value of their data in S3. And the next generation of Amazon SageMaker, which brings together all of the data analytics services and AI services into one interface to do analytics and AI more easily at scale. As 2024 comes to an end, I want to thank our teammates and partners for their meaningful impact throughout the year. It was a very successful year across almost any dimension you pick. We're far from done and look forward to delivering for customers in 2025. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian for a financial update.",neutral,0.835410893,Neutral,Slightly Positive,0.2,0.4,0.3,0.1,0,Slightly Positive
Q4_2024,Brian T. Olsavsky,"Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Andy. Starting with our top-line financial results. Worldwide revenue was $187.8 billion, an 11% increase year over year excluding the impact of foreign exchange. This equates to an approximate $900 million headwind from FX in the quarter, which is about $700 million higher than what we had anticipated in our Q4 guidance range. Excluding that additional FX headwind, we would have exceeded the top end of our revenue guidance range. Worldwide operating income was $21.2 billion, our largest operating income quarter ever, and was $1.2 billion above the high end of our guidance range. Across all segments, we continued to innovate for customers while operating more efficiently at the same time. In the North America segment, fourth quarter revenue was $115.6 billion, an increase of 10% year over year. International segment revenue was $43.4 billion, an increase of 9% year over year excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Worldwide paid units grew 11% year over year as our focus on low prices, broad selection, and fast shipping continues to resonate with customers. Shifting to profitability. North America segment operating income was $9.3 billion, an increase of $2.8 billion year over year. Operating margin was 8%, up 190 basis points year over year. In the international segment, operating income was $1.3 billion, an improvement of $1.7 billion year over year. Operating margin was 3%, up 400 basis points year over year. This marks the eighth consecutive quarter where we've seen year-over-year margin improvement in both the North America and international segments. 2024 also marks the second year in a row where we've lowered our global cost to serve on a per-unit basis. In the fourth quarter, we saw strong productivity in our transportation network from improved inventory placement, higher units per package, and reduced travel distances. We also saw improved productivity in our fulfillment centers. Overall, our teams executed extremely well throughout the quarter and particularly during our peak seasons. I want to thank them for all they do to deliver for our customers. Looking ahead, we have several opportunities to keep lowering our costs through even better inventory placement, which also allows us to deliver items to customers faster. In the U.S., we're tuning our inbound network and continuing to expand our same-day delivery network. Globally, we're adding automation and robotics throughout our network. While these efforts will take time to implement and progress may not be linear, we have a good plan to continue to drive improvements in our cost structure. Advertising remains an important contributor to profitability in the North America and international segments. This quarter, we saw strong advertising revenue growth on an increasingly large base. We will also continue to invest in experiences that have potential to be important to customers in Amazon long term in areas like Alexa, healthcare, and grocery, as well as Kuiper, including the planned launches of our production satellites in the coming months. As a reminder, we currently expense the majority of the costs associated with the development of our satellite network. We will capitalize certain costs once the service achieves commercial viability, including sales to customers. Moving next to our AWS segment. Revenue was $28.8 billion, an increase of 19% year over year. AWS now has an annualized revenue run rate of $115 billion. During the fourth quarter, we continued to see growth in both generative AI and non-generative AI offerings as companies turn their attention to newer initiatives, bring more workloads to the cloud, restart or accelerate existing migrations from on-premise to the cloud, and tap into the power of generative AI. Customers recognize to get the full benefit of generative AI, they have to move to the cloud. AWS reported operating income of $10.6 billion, an increase of $3.5 billion year over year. This is a result of strong growth, innovation in our software and infrastructure to drive efficiencies, and continued focus on cost control across the business. As we've said in the past, we expect AWS operating margins to fluctuate over time, driven in part by the level of investments we're making. Additionally, we increased the estimated useful life of our servers starting in 2024, which contributed approximately 200 basis points to the AWS margin increase year over year in Q4. Now turning to our capital investments. As a reminder, we define these as a combination of cash capex plus equipment finance leases. Capital investments were $26.3 billion in the fourth quarter. And we think that run rate will be reasonably representative of our 2025 capital investment rate. Similar to 2024, the majority of the spend will be to support the growing need for technology infrastructure. This primarily relates to AWS, including to support demand for our AI services, as well as tech infrastructure to support our North America and international segments. Additionally, we're continuing to invest and capacity for our fulfillment and transportation network to support future growth. We're also investing in same-day delivery facilities and our inbound network, as well as robotics and automation, to improve delivery speeds and to lower our cost to serve. These capital investments will support growth for many years to come. Turning to our revenue guidance for Q1. Net sales are expected to be between $151 billion and $155.5 billion. I'd like to highlight two items impacting our Q1 revenue guidance. First, we estimate the year-over-year impact of changes in foreign exchange rates based on current rates, which we expect to be a headwind of approximately $2.1 billion in Q1 year over year or 150 basis points. As a reminder, global currencies can fluctuate during the quarter and just as we saw in Q4 with the strengthening of the dollar versus most other currencies. Second, a reminder that we are comping the impact of last year's leap year. The extra day contributed approximately $1.5 billion of additional net sales across our businesses in Q1 2024 or about 120 basis points to the year-over-year growth rate, which impacted all segments. Q1 operating income is expected to be between $14 billion and $18 billion. This guidance includes the estimated impact of certain updates to the useful life of our fixed assets. I'll provide a bit more detail in a moment, but on an aggregate basis, we estimate this will decrease full year 2025 operating income by approximately $400 million for the assets on our balance sheet as of December 31st, 2024. First, in Q4, we completed a useful life study for our servers and network equipment and observed an increased pace of technology development, particularly in the area of artificial intelligence and machine learning. As a result, we're decreasing the useful life for a subset of our servers and networking equipment from six years to five years, beginning in January 2025. We anticipate this will decrease full year 2025 operating income by approximately $700 million. In addition, we also early retired a subset of our servers and network equipment. We recorded a Q4 2024 expense of approximately $920 million from accelerated depreciation and related charges and expect this will also decrease full year 2025 operating income by approximately $600 million. Both of these server and network equipment useful life changes primarily impact our AWS segment. Lastly, we also completed a useful life study for certain types of heavy equipment used in our fulfillment centers and are increasing the useful life from 10 years to 13 years beginning in January 2025. We anticipate this will increase full year 2025 operating income by approximately $900 million. As we turn the page to 2025, we're energized by the great work our teams have delivered. We'll remain focused on driving even better customer experience, and we believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for our shareholders. With that, let's move on to your questions. Operator At this time, we will now open the call up for questions. We ask each caller to please limit yourself to one question.  Please hold while we poll for questions. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.",positive,0.955562413,Strong Positive,Neutral,0.1,0.2,0.5,0.1,0.1,Strong Positive
Q4_2024,Mark Mahaney,Analyst,"Thanks. Two quick questions. So, Brian, that's $100 billion capex we should think about in '25. And then Andy, were there any -- so would you describe that AWS growth as being currently moderated down by supply constraints? Do you see those across the industry or do you see those materially impacting AWS today? Thank you very much.",neutral,0.833977878,Neutral,Neutral,0.1,0.2,0.5,0.1,0.1,Neutral
Q4_2024,Andrew R. Jassy,President and Chief Executive Officer,"So, I'll take both of those, this is Andy. On the capex side, as Brian mentioned earlier, we spent $26.3 billion in capex in Q4. And I think that is reasonably representative of what you could expect in annualized capex rate in 2025. The vast majority of that capex spend is on AI for AWS. It's the way that AWS business works and the way the cash cycle works is that the faster we grow, the more capex we end up spending because we have to procure data center and hardware and chips and networking gear ahead of when we're able to monetize it. We don't procure it unless we see significant signals of demand. And so, when AWS is expanding its capex, particularly in what we think is one of these once-in-a-lifetime type of business opportunities like AI represents, I think it's actually quite a good sign, medium to long term, for the AWS business. And I actually think that spending this capital to pursue this opportunity, which from our perspective, we think virtually every application that we know of today is going to be reinvented with AI inside of it and with inference being a core building block, just like compute and storage and database. If you believe that plus altogether new experiences that we've only dreamed about are going to actually be available to us with AI, AI represents, for sure, the biggest opportunity since cloud and probably the biggest technology shift and opportunity in business since the Internet. And so, I think that both our business, our customers, and shareholders will be happy medium to long term that we're pursuing the capital opportunity and the business opportunity in AI. We also have capex that we're spending this year in our stores business, really with an aim toward trying to continue to improve the delivery speed and our cost to serve. And so, you'll see us expanding the number of same-day facilities from where we are right now. You'll also see us expand the number of delivery stations that we have in rural areas. We can get items to people who live in rural areas much more quickly, and then a pretty significant investment as well on robotics and automation so we can take our cost to serve down and continue to improve our productivity. So, that's the capex piece. I think the second question you asked, Mark, is really around AWS growth and whether this is being moderated down at all by supply chain constraints. It is hard to complain when you have a multibillion-dollar annualized revenue run rate business in AI, like we do, and it's growing triple-digit percentage year over year. It's hard to complain. However, it is true that we could be growing faster, if not for some of the constraints on capacity. And they come in the form of, I would say, chips from our third-party partners, come a little bit slower than before with a lot of midstream changes that take a little bit of time to get the hardware actually yielding the percentage healthy and high-quality servers we expect. It comes with our own big new launch of our own hardware and our own chips and Trainium2, which we just went to general availability at re:Invent, but the majority of the volume is coming in really over the next couple of quarters, the next few months. It comes in the form of power constraints where I think the world is still constrained on power from where I think we all believe we could serve customers if we were unconstrained. There are some components in the supply chain, like motherboards too, that are a little bit short in supply for various types of servers. So, I think the team has done a really good job scrapping and providing capacity for our customers they can grow. We're still growing at a pretty reasonable clip, as I mentioned earlier, but I do think we could be growing faster if we were unconstrained. I predict those constraints really start to relax in the second half of '25. And as I said, I think we can be growing faster even though we're growing at a pretty good clip today.

Q4_2024,Eric Sheridan,Analyst,"Thanks so much for taking the question. I'll just ask one that's building on Mark's questions there. Andy, when you think about the news that came out of China over the last couple of weeks and think longer term about bending the cost curve lower with AI, I understood the commentary around capex for 2025. But when you look at where you sit in the industry, the move toward open source, elements of custom silicon, how do you think about bending the cost curve and either speeding up or amplifying time deployment to market or possibly higher returns on capital for AI? Thanks so much.",neutral,0.826696038,Neutral,Neutral,0.1,0.2,0.5,0.1,0.1,Neutral
Q4_2024,Andrew R. Jassy,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Well, I'd say a few things because there are a few questions built into that. First of all, I think like many others, we were impressed with what DeepSeek has done. I think in part impressed with some of the training techniques, primarily in flipping the sequencing of reinforcement training -- reinforcement learning being earlier and without the human-in-the-loop. We thought that was interesting ahead of the supervised fine-tuning. We also thought some of the inference optimizations they did were also quite interesting. For those of us who are building frontier models, we're all working on the same types of things and we're all learning from one another. I think you have seen and will continue to see a lot of leapfrogging between us. There is a lot of innovation to come. And I think if you run a business like AWS and you have a core belief like we do, that virtually all the big generative AI apps are going to use multiple model types, and different customers are going to use different models for different types of workloads. You're going to provide as many leading frontier models as possible for customers to choose from. That's what we've done with services like Amazon Bedrock. And it's why we moved so quickly to make sure that DeepSeek was available both in Bedrock and in SageMaker faster than you saw from others. And we already have customers starting to experiment with that. I think what's -- one of the interesting things over the last couple of weeks is sometimes people make the assumptions that if you're able to decrease the cost of any type of technology component, in this case, we're really talking about inference, that somehow it's going to lead to less total spend in technology. And we have never seen that to be the case. We did the same thing in the cloud where we launched AWS in 2006, where we offered S3 object storage for $0.15 a gigabyte and compute for $0.10 an hour, which, of course, is much lower now many years later. People thought that people would spend a lot less money on infrastructure technology. And what happens is companies will spend a lot less per unit of infrastructure, and that is very, very useful for their businesses. But then they get excited about what else they could build that they always thought was cost-prohibitive before, and they usually end up spending a lot more in total on technology once you make the per unit cost less. And I think that is very much what's going to happen here in AI, which is the cost of inference will substantially come down. What you heard in the last couple of weeks that DeepSeek is a piece of it. But everybody is working on this. I believe the cost of inference will meaningfully come down. I think it will make it much easier for companies to be able to infuse all their applications with inference and with generative AI. And I think it's going to -- if you run a business like we do, where we want to make it as easy as possible for customers to be successful building customer experiences on top of our various infrastructure services, the cost of inference coming down is going to be very positive for customers and for our business.

Q4_2024,Doug Anmuth,Analyst,"Thanks for taking the questions. I'll stick with AWS to start. Just Brian, maybe you can talk a little bit more about margins there, just given that they've kind of moved between the mid-20s to high 30s over the past two years. How should we think about that more normalized especially as you're investing that much more in generative AI? And then just on the stores side, can you talk about the impact of less volume going through your shipping partner, UPS, going forward?

Q4_2024,Brian T. Olsavsky,"Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. Sure, Doug. Thanks for your question. First on AWS, yes, we have seen a lot of fluctuation in operating margin in AWS. And we've said historically that they will be lumpy, as you say, over time. And at the stage we're in right now, AI is still early stage. It does come originally with lower margins and a heavy investment load as we've talked about. And in the short term, over time, that should have -- be a headwind on margins. But over the long term, we feel the margins will be comparable in non-AI business as well. So, we're very pleased with the strong growth, focused on driving efficiencies in all of our data centers, saving power. We're using power in new generative AI applications and just generally reducing costs.

Q4_2024,Andrew R. Jassy,President and Chief Executive Officer,"I'll take the UPS one, which is really, UPS has been a partner of ours for many years, and we expect that we'll continue to be partners with UPS for many years. As you know, increasingly, over the last several years, particularly accelerated by the pandemic, we have shipped a much larger percentage of our shipments through our own logistics network, our own last-mile transportation network. And yes, I think that's in part because we needed to scale up so fast in the pandemic with everything being shut down and needing to serve more of the total market segment share of retail units during that time, and needing to do it at a low-cost structure because, of course, our customers expect low prices and that's the nature of the business. I think UPS has decided that serving Amazon is lower margin for them. And so, I think they've walked away from some of the volume that they otherwise could have had in the partnership. We're able to handle it with our own logistics capability, and we'll see how it continues to evolve. Operator And the next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.

Q4_2024,Andrew R. Jassy,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah. OK. Well, on the robotics piece, what I would tell you is since we've been pretty substantially integrating robotics into our fulfillment network over the last many years, we have seen cost savings and we've seen productivity improvements and we've seen safety improvements. And so, we have already gotten a significant amount of value out of our robotics innovations. What we've seen recently, and I think maybe part of what you're referencing in Shreveport, is that the next tranche of robotics initiatives have started hitting production. And we've put them all together for the first time as part of an experience in our Shreveport facility. And we are very, very encouraged by what we're seeing there, by both the speed improvements that we're seeing, the productivity improvements, the cost to serve improvements. It's still relatively early days, and these all being put together only in Shreveport at this point, but we have plans now to start to expand that and roll that out to a number of other facilities in the network, some of which will be our new facilities and others of which we'll retrofit existing facilities to be able to use those same robotics innovations. I'll also tell you that this group of, call it, a half a dozen or so new initiatives is not close to the end of what we think is possible with respect to being able to use robotics to improve the productivity cost to serve and safety in our fulfillment network. And we have kind of the next wave that we're starting to work on now. But I think this will be a many-year effort as we continue to tune different parts of our fulfillment network where we can use robotics. And we actually don't think there are that many things that we can't improve the experience with robotics. On your other question, which is, I think, really about how we might use AI in other areas of the business, in AWS, maybe more, I think you asked about our retail business. The way I would think about it is that there's kind of two macro buckets of how we see people, both ourselves inside Amazon, as well as other companies using AWS, how we see them getting value out of AI today. The first macro bucket, I would say, is really around productivity and cost savings. And in many ways, this is the lowest-hanging fruit in AI, and you see that all over the place in our retail business. For instance, if you look at customer service and you look at the chatbot that we've built, we completely rearchitected it with generative AI. It's delivering. It already had pretty high satisfaction. It's delivering 500 basis points better satisfaction from customers with the new generative AI-infused chatbot. If you look at our millions of third-party selling partners, one of their biggest pain points is because we put a high premium on really organizing our marketplace so it's easy to find things, there's a bunch of different fields you have to fill out when you're creating a new product detail page, but we've built a generative AI application for them where they can either fill in just a couple of lines of text or take a picture of an image or point to a URL, and the generative AI app will fill in most of the rest of the information they have to fill out, which speeds are getting selection on the website easier for sellers. If you look at how we do inventory management and trying to understand what inventory we need and what facility at what time, the generative AI applications we've built there have led to 10% better forecasting on our part and 20% better regional predictions. In our robotics, we were just talking about the brains in a lot of those robotics, or generative AI infused to do things like tell the robotic claw, what's in a bin, what it should pick up, how it should move in, where it should place it in the other bin that it's sitting next to. So, it's really in the brains of most of our robotics. So, we have a number of very significant, I'll call it, productivity and cost savings efforts in our retail business. They're using generative AI. And again, it's just a fraction of what we have going. I'd say the other big macro bucket are really altogether new experiences. And again, you see lots of those in our retail business, ranging from Rufus, which is our AI-infused shopping assistant, which continues to grow very significantly, to things like Amazon Lens, where you can take a picture of a product that's in front of you, check it out in the app, you can find it in the little box at the top. You take a picture of an item in front of you, and it uses computer vision and generative AI to pull up the exact item in search result; to things like sizing, where we basically have taken the catalogs of all these different clothing manufacturers and then compare them against one another so we know which brands tend to run big or small relative to each other. So, when you come to buy a pair of shoes, for instance, it can recommend what size you need. To even what we're doing in Thursday Night Football, where we're using generative AI for really inventive features like it sends alerts where we predict which player is going to Blitz, the quarterback or defensive vulnerabilities where we were able to show viewers what area of the field is vulnerable. So, we're using it really all over our retail business and all the businesses in which we're in. We've got about 1,000 different generative AI applications we've either built or in the process of building right now.

Q4_2024,John Blackledge,Analyst,"Great. Thanks. Could you talk about the current speed of delivery? Maybe how much more room to go there and how is it driving the everyday essentials business? And then somewhat relatedly, any further color on inbound network efficiencies you would expect to see this year as you guys try to continue to lower the cost to serve? Thank you.",neutral,0.633270502,Neutral,Neutral,0.1,0.2,0.5,0.1,0.1,Neutral
Q4_2024,Andrew R. Jassy,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah. I would say on speed of delivery that we measure this very carefully. And we measure both, what the conversion rate is of somebody who views a product detail page with a faster delivery promise versus those that are slower,, as well as what we see downstream from customers once they bought with a fast promise and what they end up buying throughout the year. And we have not yet seen diminishing returns and being able to continue to improve the speed of delivery. It doesn't mean that there won't be instances in which people are happy to take products later. We have a program where people want to pick a day during the week where they want to combine a bunch of their shipments and have it delivered then to be more sustainable and more environmentally friendly they can. And we have plenty of customers who choose that, but we time in and time out, see that people choose to buy from us more frequently, and we're able to deliver to their homes or wherever they are much more quickly. And it leads to actually using us for more of their everyday purchases when we can deliver more quickly. And I think that if you look at what we're doing with Prime Air, the promise there is for a number of items that we'll be able to deliver items to customers inside an hour. And I think when you're ordering everyday essentials where you need something more quickly, it's a big deal. And you see it, it's had a big impact on our everyday essentials. It's had a big impact on our pharmacy business, where people are able to get items same day now in lots of cities throughout the U.S. And they're just using us much more frequently than they had before. On the inbound network efficiencies, what I would tell you is we've made a pretty significant architectural change in our inbound network, that we've been working on for the better part of the year that we rolled out just a few months ago. Again, what we find when we make big architectural changes like this is that you tend to get some low-hanging fruit efficiencies early, but then there's all sorts of tuning and refinement you have to do once you actually see it working live across the really vast network. And we have all sorts of ways here that, where I think it's early, and I think we're going to get additional efficiencies throughout the year. But I expect that we'll have opportunities to keep taking our cost to serve down this year and that will be a big part of it.

Q4_2024,Andrew R. Jassy,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Well, I would say that I think retailers ourselves and probably lots of other retailers are all going to have their own say on how they want to interact with agents. I think that it's an emerging space. And if you think about the investments that we've made in our fulfillment network, in our website, in all the selection that we've built, how we organize it, most retailers are going to have kind of terms in which they're going to interact with agents, and we'll be no different that way. And I think that -- I do think that Rufus, if you look at what -- how it impacts the customer experience and if you actually use it month-to-month, it continues to get better and better. It's already -- if you're buying something and you're on a product detail page, our product detail pages provide so much information that sometimes it's hard if you're trying to find something quickly to scroll through and figure -- and find that little piece of information. And so, we have so many customers now who just use Rufus to help them find a quick fact about a product. They also use Rufus to figure out how to summarize customer reviews so they don't have to read 100 customer reviews to get a sense of what people think about that product. If you look at the personalization, really, most prominently today, your ability to go into Rufus and ask what's happened to an order or what did I just order, or can you pull up for me this item that I ordered two months ago?

Q1_2023,Brian Olsavsky,Chief Financial Officer,"Thank you for joining today's call. As Dave mentioned earlier, I'm joined today by Andy Jassy, our CEO. Before we move on to take your questions, I'll make some comments regarding our Q1 results. Let's begin with revenue. For the first quarter, our worldwide net sales were $127.4 billion, up 9% year over year, or 11% excluding approximately 210 basis points of unfavorable impact from changes in foreign exchange rates. This was above the top end of our guidance range. Overall, we are pleased with the growth that we're seeing in worldwide stores businesses, including quarter-over-quarter revenue acceleration in the international segment, which is helped by easing macroeconomic pressures in Europe. Across the geographies we serve, customers appreciate our focus on staying sharp on pricing, having strong selection, and easier convenience, including delivery speeds, which continued to improve throughout the first quarter. That said, the uncertain economic environment and ongoing inflationary pressures continue to be a factor, and we believe it's continuing to drive cautious spending across consumers. This means our customers are looking to stretch their budgets further and are focused on value. We saw moderated spending on discretionary categories, as well as shifts to lower-priced items and healthy demand in everyday essentials, such as consumables and beauty. Third-party sellers, including businesses who elect to utilize Fulfillment by Amazon for their storage and shipping services are a key contributor to the selection offered to customers. We also continued to invest meaningfully in brand protection efforts, including industry-leading technology so that sellers can trust we will provide a great selling experience free from bad actors. Sellers comprised 59% of overall unit sales in Q1, up from 55% one year ago. We also saw strong engagement in our advertising services with revenue up 23% year over year, excluding the impact from changes in foreign exchange rates. In particular, our sponsored product and brand offerings remain a key driver of growth as we work with advertisers to help customers make more informed purchase decisions. Our teams remain focused on delivering performance through our comprehensive and flexible measurement capabilities along with insights that allow advertisers the ability to measure the return on their advertising spend and help them grow their business. In AWS, net sales were $21.4 billion in the first quarter, up 16% year over year and representing an annualized sales run rate of more than $85 billion. Given the ongoing economic uncertainty, customers of all sizes in all industries continue to look for cost savings across their businesses, similar to what you've seen us doing at Amazon. As expected, customers continue to evaluate ways to optimize their cloud spending in response to these tough economic conditions in the first quarter. And we are seeing these optimizations continue into the second quarter with April revenue growth rates about 500 basis points lower than what we saw in Q1. As a reminder, we're not trying to optimize for any one quarter or year. We're working to build customer relationships and a business that will outlast all of us. Therefore, our AWS sales and support teams continue to spend much of their time helping customers optimize their AWS spend so that they can better weather this uncertain economy. This customer orientation is built into our DNA and how we think about our customer relationships and business over the long term. Now, let's shift to worldwide operating income. For the first quarter, we reported $4.8 billion in operating income, above the top end of our guidance range. This operating income was negatively impacted by an estimated employee severance charge of approximately $470 million in Q1, including $270 million related to AWS. As we finalized our annual planning process and considered the ongoing economic environment, we made the difficult decision to eliminate 9,000 roles, impacting our AWS business, as well as Twitch, devices, advertising, and our human resources teams. In Q1, our year-over-year growth in stores revenue and unit sales outpaced growth in both our fulfillment expense and our outbound shipping costs. Inflationary pressures continued to ease quarter over quarter, primarily driven by reductions in linehaul shipping rates, as well as lower diesel fuel and electricity costs. We also built on the progress we made throughout 2022 in improving productivity in our fulfillment network through continued process and tech improvements. We exited Q4 with a good balance of labor throughout the network and leveraged that throughout Q1 with customer demand patterns remaining more stable compared to Q1 of last year. As labor availability has stabilized and inventory supply chain challenges have moderated, we're able to implement some significant structural changes to transition our U.S. fulfillment network to a regionalized model. We believe these improvements put us in a good position to improve both delivery speed and our cost to serve customers over time. We reported overall net income of $3.2 billion in the first quarter. While we primarily focus our comments on operating income, I'd point out that this net income includes a pre-tax valuation loss of $467 million included in nonoperating expense from our common stock investment in Rivian Automotive. As we've noted in recent quarters, this activity is not related to Amazon's ongoing operations but rather to quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in Rivian's stock price. Turning to cash flows. We remain focused on building long-term sustainable growth in free cash flow, including our efforts toward a strong cash flow accretive working capital cycle. Our operating cash flow for the trailing 12 months ended March 31 increased to $54.3 billion, up 38% versus the comparable period year over year. Besides the cash benefit of improved profitability year over year, we've also seen supply chains easing up and made progress to improve our inventory purchasing and payment cycles, which in turn has a positive impact on working capital. Now, let's turn to our capital investments. We define our capital investments as the combination of capex plus equipment finance leases. For the full year 2023, we expect capital investments to be lower than our $59 billion investment level in 2022, primarily driven by an expected year-over-year decrease in fulfillment network investments. We're continuing to invest in infrastructure to support AWS customer needs, including investments to support large language models and generative AI. Before we open the call up for your questions, I'll hand it over to Andy to share some high-level perspectives on the first quarter.",positive,0.95852387,Strong Positive,Neutral,0.1,0.2,0.5,0.1,0.1,Slightly Negative
Q1_2023,Andy Jassy,Chief Executive Officer,"Thanks, Brian. I'll share a few thoughts before opening up for questions. From my perspective, I think there's a fair bit to like about how our teams are delivering for customers and the results we're starting to see. In our storage business, we've been very focused on reducing our cost to serve in our fulfillment network. As we shared in the past, given the unexpected surge in demand during the pandemic, we doubled the size of our fulfillment center footprint and largely built the transportation network the size of UPS in a couple of years. This ended up substantially changing the number of nodes and connections in our fulfillment network. And as a result, we spent the last several months not only redesigning dozens of processes to drive better productivity but also rearchitecting our placement approach and larger fulfillment center footprint to move from national fulfillment network in the U.S. to a regional one. It means we've created eight interconnected regions in geographic areas with each of these regions having broad relevant selection to operate in a largely self-sufficient way while still being able to ship nationally when necessary. We just recently completed this rollout and are quite bullish on the early results. Not surprisingly, shorter travel distances means lower cost to serve and customers getting their orders faster. And while on the topic of delivery speed, we're really excited about our progress in providing customers with more one-day and same-day deliveries and are on track to have our fastest Prime delivery speeds ever in 2023. On the advertising side, we're continuing to buck wider advertising trends and deliver robust growth. I think there are a few reasons for it. First, even in difficult economies, most people still shop. And with the largest e-commerce shopping venue, we have a lot of customers that companies seek to reach. That, coupled with our very substantial investment in machine learning to make sure customers see relevant ads when they're looking for various items, have meant that these advertisements have performed unusually well for brands, which makes them want to advertise in Amazon. It's also worth noting that we're still very early in our efforts to find a way to thoughtfully place ads in our broader video, live sports, audio, and grocery properties. We have a lot of upside still in advertising. In AWS, what we're seeing is enterprises continuing to be cautious in their spending in this uncertain time. Customers are looking for ways to save money however they can right now. They tell us that most of it is cost optimizing versus cost-cutting, which is an interesting distinction because they say they're cost optimizing to reallocate those resources on new customer experiences. One of the great attributes of the cloud is that you can scale seamlessly up or down as demand dictates, which is not the case with on-premise infrastructure. Customers want help finding ways to spend less during this challenging time, and given that it's best for customers long term, we've been actively helping customers make these adjustments. We've spent a fair bit of time analyzing what we're seeing, and I've spent a good chunk of time myself looking as well, and we like the fundamentals of what we're seeing in AWS. The new customer pipeline looks strong. The set of ongoing migrations of workloads to AWS is strong. The product innovation and delivery is rapid and compelling, and people sometimes forget that 90-plus percent of global IT spend is still on-premises. If you believe that equation is going to flip, which we do, it's going to move to the cloud and having the cloud infrastructure offering with the broadest functionality by a fair bit, the best securing operational performance, and the largest partner ecosystem bodes well for us moving forward. But we're not close to being done inventing in AWS. Our recent announcement on large language models and generative AI and the chips and managed services associated with them is another recent example. And in my opinion, few folks appreciate how much new cloud business will happen over the next several years from the pending deluge of machine learning that's coming. This past year has seen us do a fair bit of cost streamlining. As I mentioned in my recent shareholder letter, we took a deep look across the company and asked ourselves whether we had conviction about each initiative's long-term potential to drive enough revenue, operating income, free cash flow, and return on invested capital. In some cases, it led us to shuttering certain businesses like our physical bookstores, Forestar Stores, Amazon Fabric, Amazon Care, and certain devices where we didn't see a path to meaningful returns. In other cases, we've looked at some programs that weren't producing the returns we'd hoped, an example of free shipping for all online grocery orders over $35 and changed them. We also made the very difficult decision to eliminate about 27,000 corporate roles. Like most leadership teams, we'll continue to evaluate what we're seeing in our business and proceed adaptively. But while we've taken several actions to streamline our costs, we've been able to do so while still pursuing the key strategic long-term investments that we believe can meaningfully make customers' lives better and potentially change what Amazon is. These are investments both in our larger businesses mentioned earlier, as well as in areas like international expansion in our stores business, large retail market segments in which we're still nascent like grocery and business-to-business, allowing consumers to use Prime off of Amazon in our Buy with Prime program, entertainment, devices, healthcare and our low Earth orbit satellite for the hundreds of millions of households, companies and government entities that have limited to no connectivity. It's hard to predict that all of these will be successful but only one or two working would change our business over the long term. We have a lot of work in front of us, but I like the direction we're headed and strongly believe our best days are in front of us. And with that, I'll open it up for questions. Operator Thank you. At this time, we will now open the call for questions. We ask each caller to please limit yourself to one question.  Thank you and please hold while we poll for questions. Our first question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question.",neutral,0.937472165,Neutral,Slightly Positive,0.2,0.4,0.3,0.1,0,Slightly Positive
Q1_2023,Doug Anmuth,JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst,"Thanks so much for taking the questions. Andy, you talked about the continued optimization. Just curious, can you talk about the degree to which optimization has been done in AWS versus what you think could still lie ahead? And when do you start to lap some of those efforts? And then also on the capex side, I think you said overall capex would be down in '23. Can you just help us understand that a little bit better between retail and AWS? And then what's required on capex from a generative AI and large language model perspective? Thanks.",neutral,0.845497251,Neutral,Neutral,0.1,0.2,0.5,0.1,0.1,Neutral
Q1_2023,Brian Olsavsky,Chief Financial Officer,"This is Brian. I'll take the first -- or the second part of that question first. On capex, we spent $59 million -- $59 billion, excuse me, last year. And on our core fulfillment and transportation areas, we actually are spending less year over year, and those estimates are going down. The GAAP or the increases in AWS and infrastructure and we are adding more dollars for large language models and generative AI. So, we're creating some space in our fulfillment and transportation number that has been repurposed over to AWS. We still think the combined capex will be lower year over year.",negative,0.839921296,Slightly Negative,Neutral,0.1,0.2,0.5,0.1,0.1,Neutral
Q1_2023,Andy Jassy,Chief Executive Officer,"Just on your first question, Doug. It's hard to say exactly where we are in the process. I think that what we continue to see when we talk with customers is that they're appropriately cautious about what they're seeing in the economy. They're trying to find ways to save money as most companies are, including our own. And we have a long track record, which we continue to pursue, which I think makes sense for customers and for our business long term that we're not trying to optimize for a quarter or for a year. We're going to do whatever it takes to help customers be successful over a long period of time because we're trying to build relationships in a business that lasts all of us. And so, we're spending a lot of time with customers, trying to help them think of smart ways, not short-term ways, but smart ways to optimize their costs and to be able to scale up and down. And again, one of the big advantages of the cloud is that if you grow quickly, you can seamlessly scale up. But when you don't have the demand, you can give it back to us and stop paying for it, and that is not true with what you see on-premises. And so, we're trying to work hard to help customers with that. I think it's important to remember that customers are pretty explicitly telling us that this is not a cost-cutting effort where we intend on spending less money on technology or on the cloud. This is our reprioritizing what matters most to our business at this time and trying to reallocate resource so we can build new customer experience of the change what's possible. And so, I think if you think about -- those projects, by the way, take time to build. When you're reallocating, you're reprioritizing, you're redefining what you're going to build, you got to actually go build it before you can implement it. And we're working pretty carefully and closely with customers on those initiatives. I think it's important to remember that there's still so much growth ahead of the cloud, 90-plus percent of the global IT spend is on premises. And so, if you believe that equation is going to flip, it's mostly moving to the cloud. And I also think that there are a lot of folks that don't realize the amount of nonconsumption right now that's going to happen and be spent in the cloud with the advent of large language models and generative AI. I think so many customer experiences are going to be reinvented and invented that haven't existed before. And that's all going to be spent in my opinion, on the cloud. Operator And our next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.",neutral,0.929319859,Neutral,Slightly Positive,0.2,0.4,0.3,0.1,0,Neutral
Q1_2023,Eric Sheridan,Goldman Sachs -- Analyst,"Thanks so much for taking the questions. Andy, you've talked a lot in the shareholder letter on the last earnings call about driving greater levels of efficiencies in the company and also possibly returning some of the margin structures we saw pre-pandemic and absorbing overcapacity that built up during the pandemic. Can you give us an update on where you think you are in those broad efforts to match margins versus pre-pandemic levels and strike the right balance between profitability and driving your growth initiatives over the next couple of years? Thanks so much.",positive,0.848203421,Slightly Positive,Neutral,0.1,0.2,0.5,0.1,0.1,Neutral
Q1_2023,Brian Olsavsky,Chief Financial Officer,"Eric, this is Brian. Let me start on the financial part of that question. So, I think we would describe ourselves as like along on the journey and making solid progress on recovering our cost structure and getting it back to pre-pandemic levels. Andy's talked about the efforts in operations and the regionalization of our operations. We've obviously taken a hard look at all of our businesses that we're in over the last six to nine months and have made adjustments there. But there's still a lot ahead of us, especially on the operational side that if you look at our operating margin in North American segment, it was 1.2 % this quarter. Pre-pandemic, that number was in the 4% to 6% range broadly. So, it's a bit of a marker on how much upside, but there's a lot of moving parts in that number. Obviously, there's the advertising, there's investments going on for future growth, and there's the core profitability and cost structure that our operations are achieving. So, making progress. We're working hard at it, but it's a longer road than bouncing back in one or two quarters.",positive,0.677628458,Slightly Positive,Slightly Positive,0.2,0.4,0.3,0.1,0,Slightly Positive
Q1_2023,Andy Jassy,Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah, I would just add to that we have looked pretty hard at every single one of our businesses. And I think that while it's probably most visible, given the size of it, the improvement in the operating margin and the efficiency in our stores business, I think every business is working really hard and finding ways to be more efficient. And as Brian said, I think we're making really, really good progress on the fulfillment costs in our operations network and our stores business. But one of the things that's been interesting and frankly pretty encouraging to all of us is that as we -- over the last six to nine months, as the network fundamentally changed, remember, when you go through as much growth as we went through and you double your fulfillment center footprint and you also build a last-mile transportation network the size of UPS in a couple of years, there's a lot that you have to work on to get that as productive as you want. And we've spent a lot of time working on that the last six to nine months. But some of the ways that you operated before, which worked through several elbows in the curve and scale when they become inefficient because the network fundamentally changes, they become inefficient in a significant way. And so, it's part of what led to the regionalization effort that I talked about, but it also caused us to really reevaluate virtually everything we do in operations over the last six to nine months. And we have found a lot more opportunities than we even thought were there before. So, I'm pretty optimistic that we have a chance not just to recover to where we were pre-pandemic in terms of operating margin, but I think there's additional upside with some of the opportunities we've identified. Operator And the next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.",positive,0.719420314,Slightly Positive,Slightly Positive,0.2,0.4,0.3,0.1,0,Slightly Positive
Q1_2023,Brian Nowak,Morgan Stanley -- Analyst,"Great, thanks for taking my questions. I have two, Andy. The first one, you talked a lot about the long-term AI and large language model potential out of AWS. I think there's a lot of discussion about AWS' competitive positioning when it comes to these tools. Could you just sort of walk us through two or three of the key points of differentiation that you think AWS offers and AI tools versus some of the competitors? And then the second one around Echo and Alexa. The neural networks may not be a leading edge of technology now with the rapid emergence of some of these new large language models. How do you think about the key investment priorities for Echo and Alexa going forward? And what's your view on ROIC around that division? Thanks.",neutral,0.888358533,Neutral,Neutral,0.1,0.2,0.5,0.1,0.1,Neutral
Q1_2023,Andy Jassy,Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah. I'll try and answer those together because they're somewhat related. I think when you think about machine learning, it's useful to remember that we have had a pretty substantial investment in machine learning for 25-plus years in Amazon. It's deeply ingrained in virtually everything we do. It fuels our personalized e-commerce recommendations. It drives the Pick Pass and our fulfillment centers. We have it in our Go stores. We have it in our Prime Air, our drones. It's obviously in Alexa. And then AWS, we have 25-plus machine learning services where we have the broadest machine learning functionality and customer base by a fair bit. And so, it is deeply ingrained in our heritage. I think if you look at what's happened over the last nine months or so is that these large language models and generative AI capabilities, they've been around for a while, but frankly, the models were not that compelling before about six, nine months ago. And they have gotten so much bigger and so much better, much more quickly that it really presents a remarkable opportunity to transform virtually every customer experience that exists and many that don't exist that weren't really that easily made possible before. And so, it's very early days in that space, but probably not surprisingly, we've been investing in building in our own large language models for several years, and we have a very large investment across the company. And the way I would break it out, Brian, is I would say that there's three macro areas in this space. If you think about maybe the bottom layer here is that all of the large language models are going to run on compute. And the key to that compute is going to be the chip that's in that compute. And to date, I think a lot of the chips there, particularly GPUs, which are optimized for this type of workload, they're expensive and they're scarce. It's hard to find enough capacity. And so, in AWS, we've been working for several years on building customized machine learning chips, and we built a chip that's specialized for training, machine learning training, which we call Trainium; and a chip that's specialized for inference or the predictions that come from the model called Inferentia. The reality, by the way, is that most people are spending most of their time and money on the training. But as these models graduate to production, where they're in the apps, all the spend is going to be an inference. So, they both matter a lot. And if you look at -- we just released our second versions of both Trainium and Inferentia. And the combination of price and performance that you can get from those chips is pretty differentiated and very significant. So, we think that a lot of that machine learning training and inference will run on AWS. Then if you think about -- so you have to train the models, you have to run the inference, then you got to -- but you have to build the models. And if you look at the really significant leading large language models, they take many years to build and many billions of dollars to build. And there will be a small number of companies that want to invest that time and money, and we'll be one of them in Amazon. But most companies don't. And so, what most companies really want and what they tell AWS is that they'd like to use one of those foundational models and then have the ability to customize it for their own proprietary data and their own needs and customer experience. And they want to do it in a way where they don't leak their unique IP to the broader generalized model. And that's what Bedrock is, which we just announced a week ago or so. It's a managed foundational model service where people can run foundational models from Amazon, which we're exposing ourselves to, which we call Titan. Or they can run it from leading large language model providers like AI21 and Anthropic and Stability AI. And they can run those models, take the baseline, customize them for their own purposes, and then be able to run it with the same security and privacy and all the features they use for the rest of their applications in AWS. That's very compelling for customers. And then that third layer are really the applications that are going to be built on top of those large language models. So, ChatGPT is a good example of an application that's being built. We'll build some of those applications ourselves. So, for instance, we think one of the most compelling applications that are going to be built in generative AI have to do with making developers much more effective with coding assistance. And so, we built something called CodeWhisperer, which we just announced the general availability for, where developers can plug in a natural language, something like -- I want to build a video hosting website. And CodeWhisperer will bring up the code you need and the developer needs to employ and put that in production, which is really compelling. If you think about how much more productive a developer is going to be and what they're going to spend their time on instead of rewriting code that as median takes time, I think it's a big deal. Now to your second question and it's related to this top layer I was just talking about, we're going to build a very -- every single one of our businesses inside Amazon are building on top of large language models to reinvent our customer experiences, and you'll see it in every single one of our businesses, stores, advertising, devices, entertain. And devices, which was your specific question, is a good example of that. I think when people often ask us about Alexa, what we often share is that if we were just building a smart speaker, it would be a much smaller investment. But we have a vision, which we have conviction about that we want to build the world's best personal assistant. And to do that, it's difficult. It's across a lot of domains and it's a very broad surface area. However, if you think about the advent of large language models and generative AI, it makes the underlying models that much more effective such that I think it really accelerates the possibility of building the world's best personal assistant. And I think we start from a pretty good spot with Alexa because we have a couple of hundred million endpoints being used across entertainment and shopping and smart home and information and a lot of involvement from third-party ecosystem partners. And we've had a large language model underneath it, but we're building one that's much larger and much more generalized and capable. And I think that's going to really rapidly accelerate our vision of becoming the world's best personal assistant. I think there's a significant business model underneath it. Operator And the next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian with Baird. Please proceed with your question.",neutral,0.917324305,Neutral,Slightly Positive,0.2,0.4,0.3,0.1,0,Slightly Positive
Q1_2023,Colin Sebastian,Robert W. Baird and Company -- Analyst,"Great, good afternoon, and thanks for taking my questions. I guess first off, on the international segment, I mean, not only an acceleration in our top line, but also on the margin side. If you could maybe add a little more color on initiatives and improvements there. And then secondly, on the physical stores, including the grocery strategy, maybe any be worth kind of going through any updated thoughts you have there around the strategy of optimizing stores across categories. And if there are any changes to the footprint plans for those businesses? Thank you.",neutral,0.799685657,Neutral,Neutral,0.1,0.2,0.5,0.1,0.1,Neutral
Q1_2023,Andy Jassy,Chief Executive Officer,"Thanks, Colin. I'll start with the international question. So, yeah, we saw an acceleration of growth on an FX-neutral basis, 9% versus 5% in Q4. I think the economy there is starting to stabilize and especially in established countries of Europe. We're seeing consumer confidence has increased and inflation is ticking down. So, some of those are similar to North America. But that is what we probably had some upside that we weren't counting on in international in the first quarter, and that was a good strength. On the margin, the negative margin has come down. Top line is helping there but it's also a function of some of the reductions that we're making across some of our investments. Most of those are in North America, but that you'll see kind of the improvement in operational efficiency and on the edge of some of the global programs are going to be reducing cost in international. I will remind you that, again, that international is an aggregation of established countries which are already profitable and who look a bit like North America, perhaps at an earlier stage of development and working their way to parity on profitability. We have forward-loaded Prime benefits in a lot of these countries that are ahead of the curve that we saw in North America. So, happy there. We have a large emerging business. In the last five years, we've added more than 10 new countries. What we're seeing is if you looked back to North America long ago, it took nine years for us to reach breakeven profitability in the United States. We see a similar curve in a lot of countries overseas. There's, in fact, additional challenges that we usually have to deal with, things like lack of payment methods, lack of the established infrastructure for -- especially for transportation and infrastructure for the internet and everything else. So, the adoption can be slower but we feel good about the businesses we're building. They carry a lot of the same traits that we have in North America. Price selection and convenience are at the core of that, very happy with the adoption and traffic and new customer acquisition that we're seeing from Prime Video in a lot of their emerging countries as well. So, good quarter. We'll continue to work again on cost structure and growing those businesses country by country. On the grocery part, what I would say is we continue to progress there. We have an interesting grocery business where we've been in it for a while and we have actually quite a large grocery business. It's just an unusual selection grocery business, very much like how the mass merchandisers got into grocery 25, 30 years ago, where the selection are items that are not temperature-controlled, so it's canned goods and packaged food and paper products and pet supplies and personal care and health and beauty and all sorts of consumables. And interestingly, in this current environment where consumers are being cautious about what they spend and finding ways to trade down in different product variations, consumables have stayed very, very strong. And so, we continue to be very pleased with that part of our grocery business to serve a much broader number of the grocery shopping journeys, which we seek to try to help customers with. We have to have a bigger physical presence since most of the shopping visits are still physical stores. We've got two efforts there. We've got Whole Foods, which really pioneered the organic grocery space. And that continues to grow nicely, and we've made a number of changes in the last year of the business that have changed the profitability trajectory there and feel very good about that. And at the same time, it is still a portion of the overall market segment. And if you really want to serve as much of grocery as we'd like to, you have to have a mass physical offering. And that's what we've been working on for a few years with the brand we've called Amazon Fresh. We wish we were further along at this point. We've tried lots of ideas. We haven't yet found conviction around the format that we want to go expand much more broadly. We have a set of experiments and ideas and concepts that we're working on across our dozens of stores there. And we're pretty optimistic that we have something that may very well work. And we're hopeful over this next year, we find that. But we continue to believe it's a big business for us today. It's continuing to get bigger, but we believe we have the opportunity for it to be much larger for Amazon and where we can help customers more broadly. And I think having that physical presence, we will also have the ability both to be able to serve the grocery products they come for, as well as store some other pieces and help customers across some other product lines as well. Operator And the next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America.

Q1_2023,Brian Olsavsky,Chief Financial Officer,"Hi, Justin, thank you. On AWS, I think Andy did a good job of laying out the dynamics we're seeing among customers right now and where they're cutting workloads and continued strength that we see in customers hitting their contractual limits and extending them and planning for the future. So, we feel really strongly about the outlook for the business and understand the short-term work that we're doing to help customers save money. So, I would say Q2 versus Q1, there's not an obvious year-over-year comp differential. It's just, again, understanding which customers are cutting in some areas and growing in others and helping them get on hopefully to the new initiatives that they are planning as well.",neutral,0.513049304,Neutral,Neutral,0.1,0.2,0.5,0.1,0.1,Neutral
Q1_2023,Andy Jassy,Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah. In terms of the calling out healthcare and Kuiper in my annual letter, I think what I was trying to do in the letter was explain how we think about investing in -- how we think about our big new investments that we make. I talked about in the letter that we look at a few things. We look at if it's successful, could it be big and move the needle for Amazon with the right ROICs? Is that experience being well served today elsewhere? Do we have some kind of differentiation? And do we have some confidence that the company in that area, if not, can we acquire it quickly? And we'd like the answers to those questions, we will invest. Some of those investments lead to what seem like relatively straightforward investments. And I talked a little bit about category expansion and international expansion in our stores business and some of the nascent retail market segments that are large for us that we think we can have big businesses in and business-to-business, our Amazon business entity and grocery, and things like Buy with Prime, which allow our consumers to use their Prime benefit in other third-party websites beyond Amazon and also let merchants convert at a higher rate because Prime members are able to pay quickly and to get that fast, reliable shipping they get from Prime. But then there are other investments I was pointing out that sometimes don't lead to categories that people might initially guess. And AWS was a good example of that where that seemed really different for us when we started to pursue that in 2003. And we're a pretty different company because we did so even though there were a lot of people externally and internally that thought was a little bit crazy. And so, I just chose two of them there. I could have chosen a lot more. The letter was long enough as it was, so I just chose two, but I chose two that we have conviction about. On the healthcare side, when you think about that set of questions that we ask ourselves when we consider whether we should make big investments, healthcare is a multitrillion-dollar business that's very segmented, and it's really broken in the U.S. particularly, I think in other parts of the world, too, but particularly in the U.S. And we had what we thought were some differentiated ways that we could be successful at it. And I think when -- our customers have been asking us for years to provide a pharmacy. If you think about that, it's not -- that's a pretty natural extension from what we do in retail, and we've launched Amazon Pharmacy in 2020 and I think it's off to a good start. It's continuing to grow. We have a lot to do there. But a lot of our customers who like that experience said, ""Gosh, I wish you guys would help us in the broader healthcare experience."" And if you think about trying to meaningfully change that experience, primary care is right at the center of it. And if you look at the experience that's been the case for the last several decades, we're going to have a hard time convincing our grandkids that it used to be the case to get a primary care appointment, you had to call ahead of time, a month ahead to schedule an appointment and drive 20 minutes to the doctor and park and get into the facility and wait 20 minutes in reception. And you get into an exam room, you wait 10 minutes for the doctor to come in. The doctor talks to you for five minutes and then prescribes you medicine where you drive 20 minutes to go get the medicine. And that experience just doesn't make sense and won't be the case. And so, we looked at -- we had some experience when we started experimenting with Amazon Care, and we couldn't believe how much people like the streamlined experience. And we ultimately decided we didn't have the right business model there. But we came across One Medical where the digital app is very compelling and you can talk to a medical practitioner by chat or by video conference, or if you have to come into a physical facility, they have clinics around the country and you can get that appointment same day or next day. In all those cities, they have relationships with health specialists, where you're plugged into. Their ability to get reservations where you can get reservations in a day or two there. And then when you need medicine, you can have it automatically shipped to you by Amazon Pharmacy or other third-party pharmacies. It's a very, very different experience. And we think we have an opportunity to be successful in helping change that experience. And if we're successful with primary care and with pharmacy, there are a lot of other things we can help customers with as well. So, we think that's a big opportunity. I'll just briefly say on Kuiper that it's a very large number. It's hundreds of millions of households and businesses and government entities that today have limited to no connectivity to the internet. And if you just think about what you can't do if you don't have connectivity, we all take it for granted. But having that connectivity means you can take online education courses and get an education, or you can start or run a business or you can enjoy entertainment or you can shop for anything you can imagine. And for businesses and governments, to be able to have that coverage, to be able to operate much more seamlessly in the various environments in which you have to have a presence, it's a total game changer. And so, we think it has the chance to be a very large business. We haven't -- we've released some information about it in some of our designs. And it's pretty exciting to us how many customers in all those different segments are excited about it. And so, I just chose those two as exemplary of some of the inventions that come out of that investment process that you might not guess but that we think can be very significant for the company.",neutral,0.917406499,Neutral,Slightly Positive,0.2,0.4,0.3,0.1,0,Slightly Positive

Q2_2023,Andy Jassy,Chief Executive Officer,"Thank you, Dave. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today, we are reporting $134.4 billion in revenue and $7.7 billion in operating income, both of which exceeded the top end of our guidance ranges. We're encouraged by the progress we're making on several key priorities, namely lowering our cost to serve in our stores business, continuing to innovate on and improve our various customer experiences, and building new customer experiences that can meaningfully change what's possible for customers in our business long term. I'll start with our ongoing effort to lower our costs to serve in our stores' fulfillment network. Q2 saw another meaningful improvement in this area as we have steadily made progress the last several quarters. Central to our efforts has been the decision to transition our stores' fulfillment and transportation network from one national network in the United States to a series of eight separate regions serving smaller geographic areas. We keep a broad selection of inventory in each region, making it faster and less expensive to get those products to customers. Regionalization is working and has delivered a 20% reduction in number of touches for our delivered package, a 19% reduction in miles traveled to deliver packages to customers, and more than a 1,000-basis-point increase in deliveries fulfilled within region, which is now at 76%. This is a lot of progress. Sometimes I hear people make the argument that Amazon is chasing faster speed while driving its costs higher and where it doesn't matter much to customers. This argument is incorrect. There are two things to note. First, customers care a lot about faster delivery. We have a lot of data that shows when we make faster delivery promises on a detail page, customers purchase more often, not just a little higher, meaningfully higher. It's also true that when customers know they can get their items really quickly, it changes their consideration of using us for future purchases, too. Second, when shipments come from fulfillment centers that are closer to customers, they travel shorter distances, which cost less in transportation, get there faster, and is better for the environment. There's a lot of goodness in that equation. This ability to have shipments closer to customers is the result of a lot of work and invention on the regionalization side, placement logic, and local in-stock algorithms. It's also driven by our development and expansion of same-day fulfillment facilities, which is our fastest fulfillment mechanism and one of our least expensive, too. Our same-day facilities are located in the largest metro areas around the U.S. So, our top moving 100,000 SKUs but also cover millions of other SKUs from nearby fulfillment centers that inject selection into these same-day facilities and have a design that streamlines getting items from order to being ready for delivery in as little as 11 minutes. The experience has been so positive for customers in our business that we're planning to double the number of these facilities. We believe that we are far from the law of diminishing returns and improving speed for customers. While we're seeing strong early results from this regionalization effort, we still see several ways in which we can be more efficient in this structure and we believe will improve productivity further. We've also reevaluated virtually every part of our fulfillment network this past year and see additional structural changes we can make that provide future upside. We're excited about this cost to serve improvement but also remain maniacally focused on making customers' lives easier and better every day and relentlessly inventing to make it so. This means constantly trying to improve experiences that we can deliver to customers short and long term. This customer experience work is at the heart of what we do every day across every one of our businesses. Now, I can spend an hour on this call detailing various examples across the teams. For today, I'll just focus a bit on our stores and AWS businesses. For stores, our priorities continue to be providing customers with great selection, low prices, and convenience. And as we've discussed, we've been especially focused on providing even faster delivery speeds. Our speed of delivery has never been faster. In this last quarter, across the top 60 largest U.S. metro areas, more than half of Prime members' orders arrived at the same day or next day. So, far this year, we've delivered more than 1.8 billion units to U.S. Prime members the same or next day, nearly four times what we delivered at those speeds by this point in 2019. Lowering our cost to serve allows us not only to invest in these speed improvements but also add more selection at lower price points. In particular, we're growing our selection in everyday essentials, enabling customers to avoid going out to get these items and both increasing our basket sizes and the frequency with which customers choose to shop with us. We now have more than 300 million items available with U.S. Prime free shipping, including tens of millions of items with free same-day and one-day delivery. We're continuing to focus on providing great value with tens of millions of deals that help customers stretch their dollar or more. For instance, in Q2 of '23, we offered customers 144% more deals and coupons than we did in Q2 of 2022. Prime Day was similar. Amazon offered more deals than any past Prime Day event with a wide selection across millions of products. Prime members purchased more than 375 million items worldwide and saved more than $2.5 billion across the Amazon store, helping make it the biggest Prime Day ever. Next, a few words about AWS. AWS remains the clear cloud infrastructure leader with a significant leadership position with respect to number of customers, size of partner ecosystem, breadth of functionality, and the strongest operational performance. These are important factors for why AWS has grown the way it has over the last several years and for why AWS has almost doubled the revenue of any other provider. I've talked to many AWS customers over the years and continue to do so. And while all these factors I mentioned have been big drivers of the business's success, AWS customers tell us that, as importantly, they care about the very different customer focus and orientation in AWS they don't see elsewhere. As the economy has been uncertain over the last year, AWS customers have needed assistance cost optimizing to withstand this challenging time and reallocate spend to newer initiatives that better drive growth. We've proactively helped customers do this. And while customers have continued to optimize during the second quarter, we've started seeing more customers shift their focus toward driving innovation and bringing new workloads to the cloud. As a result, we've seen AWS' revenue growth rate stabilize during Q2 where we reported 12% year-over-year growth. The AWS team continues to innovate and change what's possible for customers at a rapid clip. You can see across the array of AWS product categories where AWS leads in compute, networking, storage, database, data solutions, and machine learning, among other areas, and the continued invention and delivery in these areas is pretty unusual. For instance, a few years ago, we heard consistently from customers that they wanted to find more price-performant ways to do generalized compute. And to enable that, we realized that we needed to rethink things all the way down to the silicon and set out to design our own general-purpose CPU chips. Today, more than 50,000 customers use AWS' Graviton chips and AWS Compute instances, including 98 of our top 100 Amazon EC2 customers, and these chips have about 40% better price performance than other leading x86 processors. The same sort of reimagining is happening in generative AI right now. Generative AI has captured people's imagination, but most people are talking about the application layer, specifically what OpenAI has done with ChatGPT. It's important to remember that we're in the very early days of the adoption and success of generative AI and that consumer applications is only one layer of the opportunity. We think of large language models in generative AI as having three key layers, all of which are very large in our opinion and all of which AWS is investing heavily in. At the lowest layer is the compute required to train foundational models and new inference or make predictions. Customers are excited by Amazon EC2 P5 instances powered by NVIDIA H100 GPUs to train large models and develop generative AI applications. However, to date, there's only been one viable option in the market for everybody and supply has been scarce. That, along with the chip expertise we've built over the last several years, prompted us to start working several years ago on our own custom AI chips for training called Trainium, and inference called Inferentia that are on their second versions already and are a very appealing price performance option for customers building and running large language models. We're optimistic that a lot of large language model training and inference will be run on AWS' Trainium and Inferentia chips in the future. We think of the middle layer as being large language models as a service. Stepping back for a second, to develop these large language models, it takes billions of dollars and multiple years to develop. Most companies tell us that they don't want to consume that resource building themselves. Rather, they want access to those large language models, want to customize them with their own data without leaking their proprietary data into the general model, have all the security, privacy, and platform features in AWS work with this new enhanced model, and then have it all wrapped in a managed service. This is what our service Bedrock does and offers customers all of these aforementioned capabilities with not just one large language model but with access to models from multiple leading large language model companies like Anthropic, Stability AI, AI21 Labs, Cohere, and Amazon's own developed large language models called Titan. Customers, including Bridgewater Associates, Kota, Lonely Planet, Omnicom, 3M, Ryanair, Showpad, and Travelers are using Amazon Bedrock to create generative AI application. And we just recently announced new capabilities from Bedrock, including new models from Cohere, Anthropic's Cloud 2, and Stability AI's Stable Diffusion XL 1.0, as well as agents for Amazon Bedrock that allow customers to create conversational agents to deliver personalized up-to-date answers based on their proprietary data and to execute actions. If you think about these first two layers I've talked about, what we're doing is democratizing access to generative AI, lowering the cost of training and running models, enabling access to large language model of choice instead of there only being one option, making it simpler for companies of all sizes and technical acumen to customize their own large language model and build generative AI applications in a secure and enterprise-grade fashion, these are all part of making generative AI accessible to everybody and very much what AWS has been doing for technology infrastructure over the last 17 years. Then that top layer is where a lot of the attention of focus, and these are the actual applications that run on top of these large language models. As I mentioned, ChatGPT is an example. We believe one of the early compelling generative AI applications is a coding companion. It's why we built Amazon CodeWhisperer, an AI-powered coding companion, which recommends code directly in the accelerating developer productivity as they code. It's off to a very strong start and changes the game with respect to developer productivity. Inside Amazon, every one of our teams is working on building generative AI applications that reinvent and enhance their customers' experience. But while we will build a number of these applications ourselves, most will be built by other companies, and we're optimistic that the largest number of these will be built on AWS. Remember, the core of AI is data. People want to bring generative AI models to the data, not the other way around. AWS not only has the broadest array of storage, database, analytics, and data management services for customers, it also has more customers and data store than anybody else. Coupled with providing customers with unmatched choices at these three layers of the generative AI stack, as well as Bedrock's enterprise-grade security that's required for enterprises to feel comfortable putting generative AI applications into production, we think AWS is poised to be customers' long-term partner of choice in generative AI. We're also continuing to make meaningful progress in building new customer experiences that can meaningfully change what's possible for customers in our business long term. Amazon Business is one of our fastest-growing offerings with a $35 billion annual gross sales run rate. And the team is working hard to further build out the selection, value, convenience, and features that business customers need. Buy with Prime is continuing to show a lot of progress. Merchants in early trials who use Buy with Prime saw their shopper conversion increased by 25% on average, which makes a real difference to their business. Also, merchants who participate in Prime Day activities, in aggregate, experienced a 10x increase in daily Buy with Prime orders during the sales event period versus the month before we announced Prime Day. It's, frankly, only been a short amount of time that we've decided to invest significantly in the healthcare market segment. A lot of what we tried before were smaller experiments. But we're pleased with Amazon Pharmacy doubling its active customers in the past year, and we're pleased with the response to RxPass, which enables Prime members to receive all of their eligible generic medications for just $5 a month and have them delivered free to their door. One Medical has been part of Amazon for just a few months now and we're encouraged by what we're seeing there, too. Our grocery business continues to grow. We already have a very large business in nontemperature-controlled areas like consumables, pet food, beauty, and canned goods that continues to grow as we keep increasing speed and lowering our cost to serve, which allows us to sell more items more cost-effectively. Whole Foods continues to lead the organic grocery space, is growing at a healthy clip, and has meaningfully improved its profitability in the last year. We're pleased with what we're seeing with Whole Foods. And as I've shared before, we're working on new formats in our mass physical store offering, Amazon Fresh, having significantly improved the number of the key business inputs and just rolled out new concepts in stores. We also see substantial innovation and progress in other areas like Kuiper, Zoox, and Alexa. We're still relatively early in many of our investments with technology inventions that are changing what's possible to deliver for customers in these areas, but they're big long-term opportunities that we remain optimistic about. Finally, I want to recognize our teams on being named No. 1 in LinkedIn's Top Companies to Grow Your Career in the United States. It's a testament to our work to be a great employer with leading compensation benefits and upskilling opportunities. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian.",positive,0.949149072,Strong Positive,Slightly Positive,0.2,0.4,0.3,0.1,0,Strong Positive
Q2_2023,Brian Olsavsky,Chief Financial Officer,"Thank you, Andy. As Andy mentioned, we saw worldwide revenue of $134.4 billion, an increase of 11% year over year and above the top end of our guidance range. We are encouraged by the strength in our reported revenue, which is another proof point that our focus on price, selection, and convenience continues to resonate with customers. We continue to see healthy demand across everyday essentials and in categories like beauty and health and personal care and have seen a positive customer response to improvements in personalization and enhancements to our website and mobile app. During the quarter, we also saw improvements in macroeconomic indicators across our North America and international segments but continue to see customers trading down and seeking value in their purchases. Delivery speed has been a key area of focus over the last several quarters and we reached record levels during Q2. Prime members love the faster ship speeds and are shopping more often. Advertising revenue remained strong, up 22% year over year. Our performance-based advertising offerings continue to be the largest contributor to our growth. Our teams worked to increase the relevancy of the ads we show to our customers by leveraging machine learning and improve our ability to measure the return on advertising spend for brands. Third-party unit mix increased to 60% during the quarter, the highest level we've ever seen, and we're continuing to see good growth in the number of sellers and the unit sold per seller. We're making steady progress on improving our worldwide stores' profitability. Since North America segment operating margins bottomed out in Q1 of 2022, we have seen five consecutive quarters of improvement, with second-quarter operating margin of 3.9%. This is an improvement of 620 basis points over these past five quarters. One of the largest drivers of this operating income improvement in the stores business has been reducing our cost to serve, with shipping costs and fulfillment costs continuing to grow at a slower pace than our unit growth. Most recently, regionalization is an important contributor. Faster delivery speed from better network connectivity and better inventory placement means less miles traveled and fewer touches, resulting in less cost. And while we are pleased with the progress we have made, we see more opportunity to drive improved cost efficiencies going forward. Moving to the international segment. Since our operating margin loss bottomed out in Q3 of last year, we have seen three consecutive quarters of improvement with a second-quarter margin loss of negative 3%. This is an improvement of 590 basis points over the last three quarters. This segment also includes our emerging countries. It is important to remember how early we are in some of these marketplaces. We've launched more than 10 countries in the past six years and are always evaluating our customer experience, as well as our path to profitability, and we like the path we're on. As a reminder, it took us nine years to reach profitability in the United States. In addition, across our North America and international results, inflation headwinds also continue to ease, most notably in fuel prices, linehaul rates, ocean, and rail rates. Moving to AWS. Year-over-year revenue growth was 12% with growth rates stabilizing during Q2. We are encouraged by the strength of our customer pipeline and believe having a large diverse customer base that is mostly cost-optimized sets us up well for future growth. On a trailing 12-month basis, free cash flow was positive and improved for the fourth sequential quarter. Our financial focus remains on driving long-term sustainable free cash flows. The largest driver of the recent improvement in free cash flow is our increased operating income, most notably in the North America and international segments where, as I said, we've made meaningful improvement in our fulfillment network productivity and operating leverage and benefited from moderating inflationary pressures. We've also seen improvements in our working capital contributions to free cash flow. Over the past couple of years, working capital hasn't been as efficient as we've held higher weeks of cover of inventory in the face of supply chain disruptions. Most recently, as these disruptions continue to ease, we are improving our inventory efficiency, resulting in improvements in our working capital. We will remain focused on continued free cash flow improvement moving forward. Next, let's turn to our capital investments. We define our capital investments as a combination of capital expenditures plus equipment finance leases. These investments were $54 billion for the trailing 12-month period ended June 30, down from $61 billion in the comparable prior year period. Looking ahead to the full year 2023, we expect capital investments to be slightly more than $50 billion compared to $59 billion in 2022. We expect fulfillment and transportation capex to be down year over year, partially offset by increased infrastructure capex to support growth of our AWS business, including additional investments related to generative AI and large language model efforts. With that, let's move on to your questions. Operator At this time, we will now open the call for questions. We ask each caller to please limit yourself to one question.  At this time, please hold while we poll for questions. Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian with Baird. Please proceed with your question.",positive,0.959183156,Strong Positive,Neutral,0.1,0.2,0.5,0.1,0.1,Strong Positive
Q2_2023,Colin Sebastian,Robert W. Baird and Company -- Analyst,"Great. Thanks. Good afternoon. I guess first on the fulfillment efficiency. Would be curious if you could give us a sense for how much of that optimization in the network with unit economics may have already been achieved in these numbers versus how much more you think is left to go. And related to that, I'm curious if you can leverage this reformulated network to help out with the grocery expansion. Or will that be limited to the stores and the specialized automated facilities you're building out? Thank you.",neutral,0.74056071,Neutral,Neutral,0.1,0.2,0.5,0.1,0.1,Neutral
Q2_2023,Brian Olsavsky,Chief Financial Officer,"Thanks, Colin. I'll take that first one. So, on fulfillment efficiency, we're encouraged again by what we're seeing with regionalization and also the efforts to control our cost structure and the -- some of the inflationary pressures coming down. We're still in that journey, though, to reclaim the cost structure that we had previously, and we consider this as a point along the road. So, encouraged by some of the margin improvements we're seeing, particularly over the last three to five quarters, but we're still underway. There's still a lot to be regained in our fulfillment area and the teams are working very hard on it. On the question of grocery, as Andy explained at different points, our grocery business has a lot of dimensions to it. Obviously, there's consumables, there's fresh goods, there's Whole Foods. The same -- sub-same-day is probably mostly impacting the first -- that pocket of the consumables and everyday essentials. And as Andy mentioned, we're able to expand our selection in those areas because our cost structure can, quite frankly, afford it when the distances of customers are shorter, and the transportation costs are more fixed.",positive,0.707550466,Slightly Positive,Neutral,0.1,0.2,0.5,0.1,0.1,Slightly Positive
Q2_2023,Andy Jassy,Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah. I'll just add to that, this is Andy, that I do think there's some optimization and some leverage we get from our fulfillment network. And particularly in the case of being able to inject a number of items into our same-day facilities, to increase the number of items that people can add at the last minute, even grocery items that they can get same day. And I think that you see some of that already, and you'll see more of that moving forward. And I also think that you'll see over time that we're going to be able to leverage being able to have -- people be able to pick up different items from different grocery-like options that are different grocery formats. But it's also true that we have infrastructure build-out in our grocery business that's different and optimized for the grocery business, too. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.",neutral,0.646025062,Neutral,Slightly Positive,0.2,0.4,0.3,0.1,0,Slightly Positive
Q2_2023,Mark Mahaney,Evercore ISI -- Analyst,"Great. I'll limit myself to one question for each of you. Amazon Business has been a couple of years since you've talked about that. It would seem like there'd be a lot more opportunities, frankly, a lot higher level of sales, bookings, whatever, that you get out of that. So, Andy, just talk about like how big of a priority is that for you? And what's the growth strategy? Like how do you take that to $100 billion? And then on the -- Brian, on AWS, the last two quarters, you provided a little bit of a look ahead into the quarter in terms of the AWS growth, given some of the commentary about moving beyond optimization and into new workloads without -- if you don't give a specific number, at least talk about the trends that you're seeing versus what you had in the second quarter. Thanks a lot.",neutral,0.908316195,Neutral,Neutral,0.1,0.2,0.5,0.1,0.1,Neutral
Q2_2023,Brian Olsavsky,Chief Financial Officer,"Yeah, sure. Thanks, Mark. Let me start with that second question. So, again, if we rewind to our last conference call, we had seen 16% AWS revenue growth in Q1, and the growth rates have been dropping during the quarter. And what I mentioned was that April was running about 500 basis points lower than Q1. What we've seen in the quarter is stabilization and you see the final 12% growth. I will stop for a moment and just put that in perspective. So, again, last Q2 last year, we had close to $20 billion of revenue and we grew that $2.4 billion. So, while that is 12%, there's a lot of cost optimization dollars that came out and a lot of new workloads and new customers that went in. So, there was -- on our base, it's very large numbers. And when customers start to that cost optimization work, they can take some of their spend down for a while as they do that, and we help them do that, and been part of our DNA ever since we started AWS. So, that's all good. What we're seeing in the quarter is that those cost optimizations, while still going on, are moderating, and many maybe behind us in some of our large customers. And now we're seeing more progression into new workloads, new business. So, those balanced out in Q2. We're not going to give segment guidance for Q3. But what I would add is that we saw Q2 trends continue into July. So, generally feel the business has stabilized, and we're looking forward to the back end of the year in the future because, as Andy said, there's a lot of new functionality coming out with -- and there's a lot of spend that will be in this area for all the great solutions that are out there for generative AI and large language models, as well as machine learning solutions that we've always had for customers. So, optimistic and starting to see some good traction with our customers' new volumes.",negative,0.742353201,Slightly Negative,Slightly Positive,0.2,0.4,0.3,0.1,0,Neutral
Q2_2023,Andy Jassy,Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah. I'll just underline one point Brian made and then quickly get to the Amazon Business point. Just if you think about the AWS business being an $88 billion revenue run rate business, to grow double digits on a business that size with the amount of cost optimizing that's been happening, to grow double digits, you have to be adding a lot of new customers and a lot of new workloads just to grow double digits. So, when I talked about last quarter, how I liked a lot of the fundamentals that we were seeing in the business with respect to customer pipeline, the new workloads, the migrations happening, what the team is rolling out functionality-wise, that's kind of what I'm talking about. And as we start to see cost optimization attenuate and more of the workloads, new workloads that people took those cost optimizations and actually started to plan come to fruition, not to mention what's coming with generative AI, there's a lot of growth in front of us on AWS. Just on your Amazon Business question, Mark, $35 billion annual run rate for gross sales is pretty strong growth. And if you look at it year over year, it continues to be very strong. But I like the way you're thinking, Mark, and it's almost like you're in some of the meetings that we're in where I asked the very same question. The team is working hard to build $100 billion-plus business over time. And I think that the business has grown to be pretty large already, and I still think we only have a fraction of the features that we need to address more of the enterprise at this point. There's all sorts of companies ordering obviously from Amazon Business. But the bigger procurement workloads, there are certain features that you need to make them much easier in the way that companies are used to buying in those big procurements. And so, we have a lot of features that we're adding. We have a number of service pieces that we need to add really around helping on big buys, do some of the service substantiations. And so, we have a lot of functionality that we're very quickly adding to mix here. But I don't think we're close to being done growing there, and that is a very strong area of focus for our stores team and for our senior leadership team as well. Operator And our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.",neutral,0.940151811,Neutral,Slightly Positive,0.2,0.4,0.3,0.1,0,Slightly Positive
Q2_2023,Brent Thill,Jefferies -- Analyst,"Thank you. Andy, just on -- sorry, AI monetization. Can you just talk to when you think you'll start to see that flow into the AWS business? Is that 2024? Do you feel like the back half, you'll start to see that as a bigger impact for the business?",neutral,0.900266647,Neutral,Neutral,0.1,0.2,0.5,0.1,0.1,Neutral
Q2_2023,Andy Jassy,Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah. Good question, Brett. What I would say is that we have had a very significant amount of business in AWS driven by machine learning and AI for several years. And you've seen that largely in the form of compute as customers have been doing a lot of machine learning training and then running their models and production on top of AWS and our compute instances. But you've also seen it in the form of the 20-plus machine learning services that we've had out there for a few years. I think when you're talking about the big potential explosion in generative AI, which everybody is excited about, including us, I think we're in the very early stages there. We're a few steps into a marathon in my opinion. I think it's going to be transformative, and I think it's going to transform virtually every customer experience that we know. But I think it's really early. I think most companies are still figuring out how they want to approach it. They're figuring out how to train models. They want to -- they don't want to build their own very large language models. They want to take other models and customize it and services like Bedrock enable them to do so. But it's very early, and so I expect that will be very large, but it will be in the future. Operator And the next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.",neutral,0.937327862,Neutral,Slightly Positive,0.1,0.5,0.3,0.1,0,Neutral
Q2_2023,Eric Sheridan,Goldman Sachs -- Analyst,"Thanks so much for taking the question, and thanks for all the detail in the prepared remarks around framing some of those key issues. Andy, maybe coming back to grocery, there's been a lot of coverage in the press around your grocery initiative in the last couple of days. When you take a step back, how much do you think about solving the grocery dynamic in the business to capitalize on it the way you want? Is an element of things you need to build and the application of capital versus elements of executing on what's already in place and sort of aligning the assets in place against the Amazon -- the scale of the Amazon Prime household in your customer base? Thanks so much.",neutral,0.870377064,Neutral,Neutral,0,0.2,0.6,0.2,0,Neutral
Q2_2023,Andy Jassy,Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah. It's a good question. It's a little bit of both. I mean, if I just step back and think about how we think about grocery, we continue to have this very big business in nonperishables, which is where a lot of the mass merchandisers started in grocery several years ago. So, these are areas like consumables and canned goods and pet food, beauty, and health. And as I said, it's a big business that's continuing to grow. But if you want to be able to serve more customers, which we do, and there are a whole number of reasons for that and customers want it, you have to have a strong physical presence. We started with Whole Foods, which is the pioneer in organic grocery, continues to be and we really like the way Whole Foods is growing. We've made a number of really important adjustments in the business has changed its profitability trajectory over the last year. And we really like where that's headed and we're expanding that meaningfully. But if you want to be really broad, you have to have a mass physical format. We have been working on that for several years with Amazon Fresh. And I would say that we weren't pleased with the inputs, the progress on the inputs there. And the team has worked very hard over the last year to first start on the quality of the input, and that goes toward the quality of what we already had in place. And these are things like the right in-stock levels, the right cost structure, the right figures on things like obsolescence, just a number of the core inputs there, we just felt like we could be sharper and better. And I think that team has made up a lot of improvements. We have spent a lot of time thinking and rethinking how we want the formats to look. And we've just started rolling out some of those new formats, starting in our Chicago stores and then moving to our Southern California stores shortly thereafter. And you see added selection. You see added private brands. You see added well-known third-party brands, like Krispy Kreme and coffee in the stores. You've seen a refined decor in the stores. You see refined dash cards that keep a running tally for people, so they understand where they are at the moment wherever they're shopping, as well as refined self-service checkouts. And all those things, to me, are part of an effort we're trying to pursue to have a format in our mass Amazon Fresh stores that resonate more with customers. And we're hopeful that we will find that format and that it gives us the type of results that give us confidence to want to expand more broadly. But we won't expand unless we see that type of resonance. We're not just going to be on discipline. We're going to be thoughtful and disciplined about it. I do think also, you're starting to see across the team pulling some of the efforts together. So, we have a number of different grocery offerings that I just talked about, just having a converged shopping cart for customers, which they have obviously wanted, and that I think will help them quite a bit. We're continuing to extend delivery to non-Prime customers as well. And so, I think there are a number of opportunities for us over time to grow the business. We're optimistic that we'll be able to do so, but we're also being disciplined about not expanding the physical fresh stores until we have a format that we think is more resonant with customers. Operator And our next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.",neutral,0.932086587,Neutral,Neutral,0,0.3,0.5,0.2,0,Slightly Positive
Q2_2023,Brian Nowak,Morgan Stanley -- Analyst,"Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one, Andy, on the last call last quarter, you talked about how you sort of talked about North America retail margins potentially getting to at or above pre-COVID levels. I think you said a margin around 4% and you're sort of talking now about investing more in grocery and expanding same-day and expanding that footprint. How should we think about sort of the forward slope of North America retail margins and sort of invest in some of these new initiatives in the retail business? Then the second one on AI. How high of an investment priority is it for you to improve your own retail and device network through more AI investments, potentially through logistics or AI-based agents, etc.? How large is that in the overall investment priority list?",neutral,0.853206635,Neutral,Neutral,0,0.2,0.6,0.2,0,Slightly Positive
Q2_2023,Andy Jassy,Chief Executive Officer,"Well, I'll start on the North America retail piece, which is again, I'll just remind that we're not going to expand the number of fresh stores in a very significant way until we believe we have something that is resonant with customers and that we're going to like the return on invested capital. So, that to me, I'm hopeful we're going to find that, but we won't until we do. I think as it relates to same-day facilities, we actually think that's going to be very positive for the business. It is -- as I mentioned in my opening remarks, it is one of our most cost-effective mechanisms and fulfillment vehicles with respect not just to getting it there to customers quickly, but being fast, in part because those facilities, they're smaller facilities. They're big enough obviously to hold, in steady state, 100,000 SKUs and then also to have all of our nearby fulfillment centers be able to inject lots of different selection in there, so we can cover several million SKUs in that same-day or one-day fashion. But they're smaller -- in general, they're smaller facilities with less conveyance and with more streamlined pick directly to pack and to get out to the dock to ship. And so, they're just much more efficient as well. So, we actually think that the expansion of those is going to not just help with speed and with demand but we're going to also like the cost structure associated with that. And I continue to believe what I said last quarter, Brian, which is I do believe that we'll get back to margins like what we had pre COVID. And I don't think that's the end of what's possible for us there. On the AI question, what I would tell you, every single one of our businesses inside of Amazon, every single one has multiple generative AI initiatives going right now. And they range from things that help us be more cost-effective and streamlined in how we run operations in various businesses to the absolute heart of every customer experience in which we offer. And so, it's true in our stores business. It's true in our AWS business. It's true in our advertising business. It's true in all our devices, and you can just imagine what we're working on with respect to Alexa there. It's true in our entertainment businesses, every single one. It is going to be at the heart of what we do. It's a significant investment and focus for us. Operator Our final question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.

Q2_2023,Doug Anmuth,JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst,"Thanks for taking the questions. Just on AWS, as you lap optimizations and the macro-driven slowdown and you start to get the new workload deployment, how do you think about what normalized growth could look like for AWS in a better macro environment? And then secondly, helpful to get the just over $50 billion capex number for this year. Just curious how generative AI changes or could change your capex trajectory going forward. Thanks.",neutral,0.883850217,Neutral,Slightly Positive,0.1,0.5,0.3,0.1,0,Neutral
Q2_2023,Andy Jassy,Chief Executive Officer,"Well, it's a good question. And I would say that while I expect there will continue to be cost optimization, I think that the balance of cost optimizations to actually new workloads and new migrations as we saw a shift in that in Q2, I expect that we'll continue to see that shift over time. And as I said, I mean, everybody has to make their own conclusions on what percentage revenue growth they believe it means. But to grow double digits on an $88 billion revenue run rate business, when you're seeing that amount of cost optimization as every company in the world is trying to save as much money as they can in the last year, to still grow double digits on a base that size means that we're acquiring a lot of new customers and a lot of new workloads. And so, I'm very bullish on the growth of AWS over the next several years. And any one quarter, it's hard for me to predict but I am bullish about it in the medium to long term for sure. I think that on the -- how much generative AI may impact the capital expense spend, included in that number is a pretty significant amount of capital expense in the AWS business for large language models and for generative AI. And we have quite a bit of demand right now. And so, like in AWS in general, one of the interesting things in AWS, and this has been true from the very earliest days, which is the more demand that you have, the more capital you need to spend because you invest in data centers and hardware upfront and then you monetize that over a long period of time. So, I would like to have the challenge of having to spend a lot more in capital in generative AI because it will mean that customers are having success and they're having success on top of our services and -- but I think that that's our best estimate right now on that capital expense and we'll update it if we find it's different.",neutral,0.84059906,Neutral,Slightly Positive,0.1,0.5,0.3,0.1,0,Neutral

Q3_2023,Andy Jassy,Chief Executive Officer,"Thanks, Dave. Today, we're reporting $143.1 billion in revenue, up 11% year over year; $11.2 billion in operating income, up 343% year over year or $8.7 billion; and $20.2 billion in trailing 12-month free cash flow adjusted for equipment finance leases, which is up $41.7 billion versus the comparable period last year. We continue to be encouraged by the progress we're making in lowering our cost to serve, improving our customer experiences and investing for future growth. I'll start with our stores business. Our move earlier this year from a single national fulfillment network in the U.S. to eight distinct regions represented one of the most significant changes to our fulfillment network in our history. This change has gone more smoothly and made more impact than we optimistically expected. And you can see the benefits in many forms. Regional fulfillment clusters with higher local in-stock levels and optimized connections between fulfillment centers and delivery stations mean shorter distances and fewer touches to get items to customers. Shorter travel distances and fewer touches mean lower cost to serve. But perhaps most importantly, shorter distances and fewer touches mean that customers are getting their shipments faster. We remain on pace to deliver the fastest delivery speeds for Prime customers in our 29-year history. And as I talked about last quarter, we know how important speed of delivery is to customer satisfaction and buying behavior. A good example is the significant growth we're seeing in consumables and everyday essentials. When customers are getting items as quickly and conveniently as they are now from Amazon, they're going to consider us more frequently for more of their shopping needs. As we've shared the last few quarters, we've reevaluated every part of our fulfillment network over the last year. The first substantial rearchitecture centered on the regionalization change. We obviously like the results, but don't think we fully realize all the benefits yet and we continue to make steady improvements in fine-tuning the placement algorithms to enable even more in-region fulfillment and to further increase consolidation into fewer shipments. We've also identified several substantial changes to our inbound processes that we believe could have a significant impact on our cost to serve and speed of delivery. We have a long way before being out of ideas to improve cost and speed. The team is really humming on this, and I'm proud of the way they're inventing and executing together. Moving to AWS and our investments in generative AI. AWS revenue grew 12% year over year in Q3, with $919 million of incremental quarter-over-quarter revenue and now has the annualized revenue run rate of $92 billion. AWS' year-over-year growth rate continued to stabilize in Q3. And while we still saw elevated cost optimization relative to a year ago, it's continued to attenuate as more companies transition to deploying net new workloads. Companies have moved more slowly in an uncertain economy in 2023 to complete deals. But we're seeing the pace and volume of closed deals pick up, and we're encouraged by the strong last couple of months of new deals signed. For perspective, we signed several new deals in September with an effective date in October that won't show up in any GAAP reported number for Q3, but the collection of which is higher than our total reported deal volume for all of Q3. Deal signings are always lumpy, and the revenue happens over several years, but we like the recent deal momentum we're seeing. Top of mind for most companies continues to be generative AI. As I mentioned last quarter, we think about generative AI as having three macro layers, each of which is very large and each of which we're investing. A few updates there. At the lowest layer is the compute to train large language models, or LLMs, and produce inferences or predictions. The key to this compute is the chip inside it. As we've shared, we've been working on custom silicon for training and inference with our Trainium and Inferentia chips, respectively. Recently, we announced that leading LLM maker, Anthropic, chose AWS as its primary cloud provider and will use Trainium and Inferentia to build, train, and deploy its future LLMs. As part of this partnership, AWS and Anthropic will collaborate on the future development of Trainium and Inferentia technology. We believe this collaboration will be helpful in continuing to accelerate the price performance advantages that Trainium and Inferentia deliver for customers. In the middle layer, which we think of as large language models as a service, we recently introduced general availability for Amazon Bedrock, which offers customers access to leading LLMs from third-party providers like Anthropic, Stability AI, Cohere, and AI21, as well as from Amazon's own LLMs called Titan, where customers can take those models, customize them using their own data, but without leaking that data back into the generalized LLM, have access to the same security, access control and features that they run the rest of their applications within AWS all through a managed service. In the last couple of months, we've announced the imminent addition of Meta's Llama 2 model to Bedrock, the first time it's being made available through a fully managed service. Also, through our expanded collaboration with Anthropic, customers will gain access to future Anthropic models through Bedrock with exclusive early access to unique features, model customization and the ability to fine-tune the models. And Bedrock has added several new compelling features, including the ability to create agents, which can be programmed to accomplish tasks like answering questions or automating workflows. In these early days of generative AI, companies are still learning which models they want to use, which models they use for what purposes and which model sizes they should use to get the latency and cost characteristics they desire. In our opinion, the only certainty is that there will continue to be a high rate of change. Bedrock helps customers with this fluidity, allowing them to rapidly experiment with move between model types and sizes and enabling them to pick the right tool for the right job. The customer reaction to Bedrock has been very positive and the general availability is buoyed that further. Bedrock is the easiest way to build and scale enterprise-ready generative AI applications and a real game changer for developers and companies trying to get value out of this new technology. And the top layer, which are the applications that run the LLMs, our generative AI coding companion, Amazon CodeWhisperer has gotten a lot of early traction and got a lot more powerful recently with the launch of its new customization capability. The No. 1 enterprise request for coding companions has been wanting these companions to be familiar with customers' proprietary code bases. It's not just having code companions trained in open-source code, companies want the equivalent of a longtime senior engineer who knows their code base well. That's what CodeWhisperer just launched, another first of its kind out there in its current form and customers are excited about it. A few last comments on AWS' generative AI work. As you can tell, we're focused on doing what we've always done for customers, taking technology that can transform customer experiences and businesses, but they can be complex and expensive and democratizing it for customers of all sizes and technical abilities. It's also worth remembering that customers want to bring the models to their data, not the other way around. And much of that data resides in AWS is the clear market segment leader in cloud infrastructure. We're innovating and delivering at a rapid rate and our approach is resonating with customers. The number of companies building generative AI apps in AWS is substantial and growing very quickly, including adidas, Booking.com, Bridgewater, Clariant, GoDaddy, LexisNexis, Merck, Royal Philips and United Airlines, to name a few. We are also seeing success with generative AI start-ups like Perplexity.ai who chose to go all in with AWS, including running future models in Trainium and Inferentia. And the AWS team has a lot of new capabilities to share with its customers at its upcoming AWS re:Invent conference. Beyond AWS, all of our significant businesses are working on generative AI applications to transform their customer experiences. There are too many for me to name on this call, but a few examples include, in our stores business, we're using generative AI to help people better discover products they want and more easily access the information needed to make decisions. We use generative AI models to forecast inventory we need in our various locations and to derive optimal last mile transportation routes for drivers to employ. We're also making it much easier for our third-party sellers to create new product pages by entering much less information and letting the models do the rest. In advertising, we just launched a generative AI image generation tool, where all brands need to do is upload a product photo and description to quickly create unique lifestyle images that will help customers discover products they love. And in Alexa, we built a much more expansive LLM and previewed the early version of this. Apart from being a more intelligent version of herself, Alexa's new conversational AI capabilities include the ability to make multiple requests at once, as well as more natural and conversational requests without having to use specific phrases. We continue to be convicted that the vision of being the world's best personal assistant is a compelling and viable one and that Alexa has a good chance to be one of the long-term winners in this arena. Every one of our businesses is building generative AI applications to change what's possible for customers, and we have a lot more to come. We're also encouraged by the progress we're making in our newer initiatives. Just to name a few, we're pleased with what we're seeing in Prime Video. Prime Video continues to be an integral part of the Prime value proposition where it's often one of the top 2 drivers of customers signing up for Prime. We also have increasing conviction that Prime Video can be a large and profitable business in its own right as we continue to invest in compelling exclusive content for prime members, but also offer the best selection of premium streaming video content anywhere with our marketplace offering, including channels for customers who can subscribe to channels like Max, Paramount+, BET Plus and MGM+, as well as our broad transaction video-on-demand selection. As we continue to invest in compelling content, beginning in early 2024, Prime Video shows and movies will include limited advertisements. We aim to have meaningfully fewer ads than linear TV and other streaming TV providers. If customers prefer and add free option, we plan to offer that for an additional $2.99 per month for U.S. members. There is still a lot of work to be done in innovation ahead, but we're excited about our future on Prime Video. We're seeing progress on a number of our investments that expand our ability to serve more consumers and sellers in their e-commerce missions. Our emerging international stores continue to improve their customer experiences and profitability and are on a strong trajectory. Both consumers and sellers are excited about Buy with Prime, which enables third-party sellers with direct-to-consumer websites to offer Amazon Prime members the same fast payments and delivery options they receive on Amazon.com. We recently announced the capability for sellers to integrate Buy with Prime with their Shopify account, making it easier for Shopify merchants to manage their businesses with inventory pricing and promotions automatically synced in one place. And we're seeing very positive early response from sellers to Supply Chain by Amazon, a fully automated set of supply chain services where Amazon can pick up inventory from manufacturing facilities around the world, ship it across borders, handle customs clearance and ground transportation, store inventory in bulk, manage replenishment across Amazon and other sales channels and deliver directly to customers, all without sellers having to worry about managing their supply chain. Our healthcare team is continuing to make healthcare easier for people to access. The Amazon Pharmacy customer experience has significantly evolved this year, and customers are responding that both in their purchasing behavior and qualitative feedback. We built RxPass for customers to get unlimited supply of eligible medications for $5 per month, meaningfully reduce the cost for customers to get insulin and diabetes products, and partnered with Blue Shield of California to offer a first-of-its-kind model to provide more affordable pharmacy care to its 4.8 million members, providing fast and free delivery of prescription medications and 24/7 access to pharmacists. We remain convinced that we can be part of the solution of making healthcare a better customer experience. And our low Earth orbit satellite initiative Project Kuiper, which aims to bring fast, affordable broadband to underserved communities around the world, took a meaningful step forward in the last few weeks with the successful launch of two prototype satellites. We will use this multi-month mission to test our satellites and network from space and collect data ahead of the planned start of satellite production later this year. I'd like to close by thanking our teams around the world who are gearing up for two of our most significant events across the company. First, our annual AWS re:Invent conference that begins on November 27th. The team is excited to share a lot of new capabilities with customers and provide an array of opportunities for builders to learn and connect with one another. And on the stores side, we've already kicked off what will be our 29th holiday shopping season. Prime Big Deal Days held earlier this month was our most successful October holiday kickoff event ever, with Prime members saving more than $1 billion across hundreds and millions of items sold. Just as we do all year long, we aim to make our customers' lives easier and better every day, and there's no time where it's more important to us that we deliver on this mission than during the busy holiday shopping season. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian.",positive,0.892828226,Strong Positive,Slightly Positive,0.1,0.4,0.4,0.1,0,Slightly Positive
Q3_2023,Brian Olsavsky,Chief Financial Officer,"Thanks, Andy. Overall, we saw a strong performance in the third quarter. Worldwide revenue was $143.1 billion, representing an increase of 11% year over year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, and approximately $100 million above the top end of our guidance range. We saw our highest quarterly worldwide operating income ever, which was $11.2 billion for the quarter, an increase of $8.7 billion year over year from $2.7 billion above the high end of our guidance range. North America revenue was $87.9 billion, an increase of 11% year over year. And international revenue was $32.1 billion, an increase of 11% year over year, excluding foreign exchange. During the quarter, we held our biggest Prime Day event ever with Prime members purchasing more than 375 million items worldwide and saving more than $2.5 billion on millions of deals across the Amazon store. Outside of Prime Day, we continue to see strong demand across everyday essentials, including categories like beauty and health and personal care. From a customer behavior standpoint, we still see customers remaining cautious about price, trading down where they can and seeking out deals, coupled with lower spending on discretionary items. Building on the momentum from last quarter, we set another record for delivery speed. For the year-to-date period through the third quarter, we have delivered at the fastest speeds ever in the United States. These improvements in delivery speeds have been a key driver of growth and are resulting in increased purchase frequency by our Prime members. Third-party sellers grew at 18% year over year, excluding foreign exchange, primarily driven by selection expansion and growing adoption of our optional services for sellers, including Fulfillment by Amazon and paid account management and more. During the quarter, we hosted Amazon Accelerate, our annual seller conference, where we launched a number of new innovations and product developments for our sellers, including Supply Chain by Amazon. We also continue to see durable growth in advertising, which grew 25% year over year, excluding foreign exchange, primarily driven by sponsored products as we lean into machine learning to improve the relevancy of the ads we show our customers and enhance our measurement capabilities on behalf of advertisers. We have seen strong improvement in our profitability. North America operating income was $4.3 billion, an increase of $4.7 billion year over year, resulting in an operating margin of 4.9%, up 100 basis points quarter over quarter. Since North America operating margins bottomed out in Q1 of 2022, we have now seen six consecutive quarters of improvement, resulting in a cumulative improvement of over 700 basis points over these past six quarters. The third quarter marked the second full quarter of regionalization within the U.S., and we're pleased with the early results. Regionalization has allowed us to simplify the network by reducing the number of line-haul lanes, increasing volume within existing line-haul lanes and adding more direct fulfillment center to delivery station connections. We have also been focused on optimizing inventory placement in a new regionalized network, which when coupled with the simplification mentioned earlier, is helping contribute to an overall reduction in cost to serve. Additionally, in the quarter, we saw benefits from lower inflation, primarily within line haul, ocean and rail shipping rates, which were partially offset by higher fuel prices. While we are encouraged by the improvements in operating profit, we still see a lot of opportunity in front of us. In international, we were closer to breakeven during the quarter with an operating loss of $95 million. This was an improvement of $2.4 billion year over year. This improvement was primarily driven by lowering our cost to serve through higher productivity, decreased inflationary pressures and improvements in leverage across our established and emerging international countries as we continue to focus on customer inputs and improve efficiencies within our operations. Moving to AWS. Revenues were $23.1 billion, an increase of 12% year over year. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, we added more than $900 million of revenue in AWS as customers are continuing to shift their focus toward driving innovation and bringing new workloads to the cloud. Similar to what we shared last quarter, while optimization still remain a headwind, we've seen the rate of new cost optimization slowdown in AWS, and we are encouraged by the strength of our customer pipeline. Customers are excited about our approach to generative AI, with several new announcements made during the quarter, including a strategic collaboration with Anthropic, opening Amazon Bedrock up to general availability, adding Meta's Llama 2 model to Bedrock in the near future and new customization capabilities of CodeWhisperer. AWS remains a clear cloud infrastructure leader with a significant leadership position in the number of customers, the size of our partner ecosystem, our breadth of functionality, and the strongest operational performance in the industry. When we look at the fundamentals of the business, we believe we are in good position to drive future growth as the rates of cost optimization slow down. AWS operating income was $7 billion, an increase of $1.6 billion year over year. Our operating margin for the quarter was 30.3%. This is an improvement of approximately 600 basis points quarter over quarter, primarily driven by increased leverage on our headcount costs. Shifting to free cash flow. On a trailing 12-month basis, free cash flow adjusted for finance leases was $20.2 billion, an improvement of $41.7 billion year over year. The largest driver of the improvement in free cash flow is our increased operating income, which we're seeing across all three of our segments. Key drivers of this improvement include reductions in our cost to serve, continued advertising growth and improved leverage on our fixed costs. We are also seeing improvements in working capital, notably with our inventory efficiency as we improve our inventory placement. Now let's turn to our capital investments. We define our capital investments as a combination of capex plus equipment finance leases. These investments were $50 billion for the trailing 12-month period ended September 30th, down from $60 billion in the comparable prior-year period. For the full year 2023, we expect capital investments to be approximately $50 billion, compared to $59 billion in 2022. We expect fulfillment and transportation capex to be down year over year, partially offset by increased infrastructure capex to support growth of our AWS business, including additional investments related to generative AI and large language model efforts. As we head into the fourth quarter, we are ready to make this a great holiday season for our customers. Looking at our operations network, our inventory is in the best position it's ever been heading into the holiday season, enabling us to serve customers with fast delivery speeds from their local regions. We continue to believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for our shareholders. With that, let's move on to questions. Operator Thank you. At this time, we will now open the call up for questions. We ask each caller to please limit yourself to one question.  At this time, please hold while we poll for questions. Thank you.

Q3_2023,Justin Post,Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst,"Thanks. Thanks for that. I'll ask about AWS. I guess the first question is, as you look forward in the fourth quarter, you mentioned you've signed some new deals. Are you seeing less cost optimization as you look forward? Or do you think it will be similar to Q3? And then second, you couldn't help but notice the big margin improvement in AWS all the way back to where you were seven quarters ago. Could you talk about the drivers and sustainability of those margins? Thank you.",neutral,0.594009936,Neutral,Neutral,0,0.2,0.6,0.2,0,Neutral
Q3_2023,Andy Jassy,Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah, Justin. Sure. This is Andy. I think if you look at AWS, we grew 12% year over year. And I think that you saw a continued stabilization of our year-over-year growth rate. And included $919 million of incremental quarter-over-quarter revenue, which it's hard to compare and do the math across different players because not everyone discloses them clearly. But as far as we can tell, that also looks like the most absolute growth of any of the players out there. We're still seeing elevated customer optimization levels than we've seen in the last year or year before this, I should say. So, if you look at the optimization, it's more than a year ago, but it's meaningfully attenuating from where we've seen in the last few quarters. And if you look at the optimization too, what's interesting is it's not all customers deciding to shut down workloads. A very significant portion of the optimization are customers taking advantage of enhanced price performance capabilities in AWS and making use of it. So, for example, if you look at the growth of customers using EC2 instances that are Graviton based, which is our custom chip that we built for generalized CPUs, the number of people and the percentage of instances launched their Graviton base as opposed to Intel or AMD base is very substantially higher than it was before. And one of the things that customers love about Graviton is that it provides 40% better price performance than the other leading x86 processors. So, you see a lot of growth in Graviton. You also see a lot of customers who are moving from the hourly on demand rates for significant portions of their workloads to one- to three-year commitments, which we call savings plans. So, those are just good examples of some of the cost optimization that customers are making in less certain economies where it's really good for customers short and long term, and I think it's also good for us. But we're starting to see -- as I said, we're seeing that optimization attenuate. I expect that to continue over time. I remain very optimistic about AWS in the medium to long term. And it's because we have the most functionality by a large amount. We have a much larger partner ecosystem than you'll find elsewhere. We have stronger security and operational performance than you can find elsewhere. I think we're the most customer-focused. Even if you look during optimization times in this difficult economy, customers have really noticed how AWS leaned in with them for the long term. And I think that matters to customers. And then we have a $92 billion revenue run rate business where 90% of the global IT spend still resides on premises. And if you believe like we do, that equation is going to flip. There's a lot more there for us. And then you look at the very substantial gigantic new generative AI opportunity, which I believe will be tens of billions of dollars of revenue for AWS over the next several years, I think we have a unique and broad approach that's really resonating with customers. And you can see it with the array of customers I mentioned that are using us and starting to build workloads for generative AI who have already on top of us. I could see it also. Just the growth rate for us in generative AI is very fast. Again, I have seen a lot of different numbers publicly. It's real hard to measure an apples-to-apples. But in our best estimation, our -- the amount of growth we're seeing and the absolute amount of generative AI business we're seeing compares very favorably with anything else I've seen externally. So, I think that you can see that in the deals that we're doing, too. I spoke about the significant number of deals that we've closed over the last couple of months. A lot of those conversations, it's -- a big piece of it is what I mentioned earlier, the functionality, the ecosystem, the operational performance, the security, how you take care of customers, but also whether or not they like your vision and set of products that you're building in this brand-new technology space, generative AI, which I think has been very effective so far. So, to me, I think there's a lot of growth in front of AWS. I'm very optimistic about it.",neutral,0.771065056,Neutral,Slightly Positive,0.1,0.5,0.3,0.1,0,Slightly Positive
Q3_2023,Brian Olsavsky,Chief Financial Officer,"And Justin, on your comment about -- a question about AWS margins. So, yeah, the margin improved 600 basis points quarter over quarter, an increase of income of $1.6 billion quarter over quarter for AWS, is driven by -- primarily by our headcount reductions in Q2 and also continued slowness in hiring, rehiring open positions. There's been also a lot of cost control in nonpeople categories, things like infrastructure costs and also discretionary costs. Natural gas prices and other energy costs have come down a bit in Q3 as well. So, as we've said historically, the margins on -- the operating margin for AWS is going to fluctuate quarter to quarter, and this is a good example of that.

Q3_2023,Doug Anmuth,JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst,"Thanks very much. Can you just talk more about how the regional fulfillment network is exceeding your expectations? And then also, how does that support your confidence in moving North America beyond mid-single-digit margin levels? And then just perhaps on generative AI, obviously, a lot of innovation here. You talked about a number of different customers running early workloads. How should we think about the timing, just to drive some tangible monetization there? Thank you.",neutral,0.587572932,Neutral,Slightly Positive,0.1,0.4,0.4,0.1,0,Neutral
Q3_2023,Brian Olsavsky,Chief Financial Officer,"Well, I'll start. The -- on regionalization, I think it was such a significant change for us in the network. It's hard to really appreciate with a big change across so many dimensions it was that first to make such a change has all sorts of risk. And I think the team did a great job planning around it and being very thorough. I think that we were able, with our placement algorithms, to get more regional local in-stock levels than we anticipated. And then I think until you actually put all the connections together, we changed a lot of the connections from a lot of these middle connections going from fulfillment centers to sortation centers and then to delivery stations to connecting the fulfillment centers and delivery stations more directly, which, of course, is easier to do when you have more local in stock in a region. But I think that we were able -- the connections that we made and the optimization that we made there allowed us to get shorter transportation distances than we even anticipated in items to people a lot quicker. And then always one of the issues you got to worry about when you make a change that big is whether or not you end up splitting shipments and having more -- fewer items per box and per shipment. And that was also something that we really had to work through in the design and in the early stages, and we've gotten a lot better on. So, we're just across the board, we're seeing shorter transportation distances and much faster delivery to customers. And when you deliver faster delivery to customers, they actually start to consider you for a lot more items than they otherwise would. I think it's part of what -- if you look at our very significant growth rates right now in everyday essentials and consumables, a lot of it is when you -- if you're going to order something which you need in the same day or next day, you're not going to consider it if it's coming in three or four days. But when you're consistently getting it in same day or the next day, just changes what you're willing to do. I think the second question was on gen AI and the timing of monetization. What I would tell you is that we have been surprised at the pace of growth in generative AI. Our generative AI business is growing very, very quickly, as I mentioned earlier. And almost by any measure, it's a pretty significant business for us already. And yet I would also say that companies are still in the relatively early stages. I mean now you have to get perspective. My perspective is that the cloud is still in the early stages. If you think about 90% plus of the global IT spend being on-premises, where I think that equation is going to flip in 10 years. I think cloud is early. So, if you -- with that lens on, I still think we're very early in generative AI. And what's interesting, too, around generative AI because we have so many companies who are doing all sorts of prototypes and it's really accelerating very rapidly on the training side with Trainium and Inferentia and then on the application building and running side with Bedrock, is that companies are still trying to sort out for themselves what they're going to run at large-scale production in all of these areas. Because what happens is you try a model, you test the model, you like the results of the model and then you plug it into your application. And what a lot of companies figure out quickly is that using the really large -- the large models and the large sizes ends up often being more expensive than what they anticipated and what they want to spend on that application. And sometimes too much latency in getting the answers as it shovels through the really large models. And so, customers are experimenting with lots of different types of models and then different model sizes to get the cost and latency characteristics that they need for different use cases. And it's one of the things that I think is so useful about Bedrock is that customers are trying so many variants right now but to have a service that not only lets you leverage lots of third party, as well as Amazon large language models, but also lots of different sizes and then makes the transition of moving those workloads easy between them is very advantageous. Operator Our next question is from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.",neutral,0.913069725,Neutral,Slightly Positive,0.1,0.5,0.3,0.1,0,Neutral
Q3_2023,Brian Nowak,Morgan Stanley -- Analyst,"Thanks for taking my question. I have two, one on AWS, one on the retail business. On AWS AI, Andy, I recognize you have a pretty multipronged AI approach. But just could you talk us through sort of one or two of the early generative AI products where you're seeing, the most early demand and interest? And as you talk to customers, are there still hurdles or pain points that you're not quite serving in your product suite you look to solve and innovate on over the next couple of years in AI? And then the second one, you made a lot of steps on the regionalization of warehouses and making it more efficient. Where are you on robotics in the warehouses? And how should we think about the potential impact of that to drive profitability even higher?",neutral,0.80889529,Neutral,Slightly Positive,0.1,0.4,0.4,0.1,0,Neutral
Q3_2023,Andy Jassy,Chief Executive Officer,"On the AI side, I think that if you're looking for some of the products that we're offering that are -- that have a lot of early resonance and traction, I would -- I'd start with Bedrock. These customers are -- they're very excited about Bedrock. And it's making it so much easier to get applications, generative AI applications built. And again, it's machine learning and AI has been something that people have been excited about for 25 years. In my opinion, about a half dozen years ago, it took a pretty significant leap forward where it was much easier given the economics and scalability of compute and storage and then some of the tools that we built like SageMaker, it was much easier for everyday developers to start to interact with AI. But it just -- it took another meaningful step forward with generative AI, but still it's complicated to actually figure out which models you want to work, you want to use and how you actually want to employ them and trying to make sure you have the right results, trying to make sure you get safe results, trying to make sure you end up with a cost structure and a customer experience that you want. And so, it's hard. And customers will like -- there's a certain number of customers who have very deep AI expert practitioners, but most companies don't. And so, Bedrock just takes so much of the difficulty out of those decisions and those variables that people are very excited about Bedrock. They're using it in a very broad way. They're extremely excited about not just the set of models in there, but if you look at a leader like Anthropic and the ability for our customers in Bedrock to have exclusive early access to models and customization tools and fine-tuning which gives them more control, there's just -- there's a lot of buzz and a lot of usage and a lot of traction around Bedrock. I would also say our chips, Trainium and Inferentia, as most people know, there's a real shortage right now in the industry in chips. It's really hard to get the amount of GPUs that everybody wants. And so, it's just another reason why Trainium and Inferentia are so attractive to people. They have better price performance characteristics than the other options out there, but also the fact that you can get access to them. And we've done, I think, a pretty good job providing supply there and ordering meaningfully in advance as well. And so, you're seeing very large LLM providers make big bets on those chips. I think Anthropic deciding to train their future LLM model on Trainium and using Inferentia as well is really a statement. And then you look at the really hot start-up Perplexity.ai, who also just made a decision to do all their training and inference on top of Trainium and Inferentia. So, those are two examples. I'd say CodeWhisperer, too, is just, again, it's just a game changer if you can allow your engineers not to have to do the more repetitive work of cutting and pasting and building certain functions that really, if somebody knew your code base better, could do. And so, it's a real -- it's a productivity game changer for developers. And then actually launching that customization vehicle so that they actually understand your own proprietary code base, that is something that customers are quite excited about. So, those are ultimately early traction AI. There's so much more to provide, Brian. I mean there's -- I think people -- even though Bedrock is so much easier to use than people trying to build models themselves and build the applications, I think people are still looking to find ways to make it easier to look at a big corpus of data and run an agent on top of it or maybe they don't have to do all that work themselves. I think people are looking for automated ways to understand different developer environments and be able to ask any question on the developer environment. So, there's a lot more. It's going to be a long time before we run out of services. And yes, I think it's a good thing to look toward the next few months in re:Invent to see the additional things that team launches. I think on the robotics piece, it's a very significant investment for us. It has been for several years. It's made a huge difference for us. It's made a big difference for us both on the productivity side, on the cost side, as well as importantly on the safety side where we can have our teammates working on things that are even safer than what they get to work on today. We have a very substantial investment of additional robotics initiatives, I would say many of which are coming to fruition in '24 and '25 that we think will make a further additional impact on the cost and productivity and safety in our fulfillment centers. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.",neutral,0.886902094,Neutral,Slightly Positive,0.1,0.4,0.4,0.1,0,Slightly Positive
Q3_2023,Eric Sheridan,Goldman Sachs -- Analyst,"Thanks so much for taking the questions. Maybe one follow-up on AWS and one on the ads business. Andy, would love your perspective. The cloud optimization theme started in the second half of '22 when there were a lot of macro concerns. And then the AI theme really only sort of came to the forefront in the last eight or nine months. What's your perspective on how turning the calendar into 2024 and there being a new IT budget cycle could possibly lead us to put the optimization theme in the background and some of the AI theme come more to the forefront when there might be more distinct budgeting around AI as a theme? That would be number one. And then in your ads business, you're approaching $50 billion run rate, and it's compounding in the mid-20s. What are you most excited about on the initiative front to continue to build scale both on Amazon properties and possibly off Amazon as a broader digital advertising player? Thanks so much.",neutral,0.8258394,Neutral,Slightly Positive,0.1,0.4,0.4,0.1,0,Neutral
Q3_2023,Andy Jassy,Chief Executive Officer,"On the AWS side, my perspective, we'll obviously all have to wait and see to some extent. But my perspective is that in 2024, you're going to -- I think a lot of the relatively low-hanging fruit on optimization has happened in 2023. It's not to say there won't be any more optimization. It's just that there's more low-hanging fruit when you have very large footprints and you've built a lot of applications on a platform for you to go decide to optimize if that's what you want to go do. And so, I think 2020 -- we're already seeing it now with the attenuation of optimization over the last several months. But I think you'll continue to see the attenuation continue, and we're already seeing more and more companies that are turning their attention to newer initiatives. And I think what you will see in '24 and '25 as well, I think -- I don't think it's a one-year deal, I think that's going to be a several-year trajectory, is that you're going to just see a lot of companies not just looking at the new generative AI workloads, but also there was a significant number of new customer transformations where companies were going to largely move from being on-premises to being in the cloud. That got stalled in 2023 because companies were being more conservative with their spend and wary of an uncertain economy. And so, I think that what you'll see increasingly is that companies will both go back to those transformations they were planning on making and working with a lot of systems integrator partners, as well as ourselves, as well as start to see the production in large scale of the generative AI applications that they're all working on and prototyping and starting to deploy into production. I think on the ad front, well, there's a lot I'm excited about on the ad side as well. I think that it's interesting what's happening in our ads business as, if you look around the industry, most advertising-heavy companies have struggled growth-wise as the economy has been difficult. And while we see companies being more cautious on the ad side and the top-of-funnel products, things like display and a little bit of video, we're still seeing a lot of strength in the lower-funnel ad products like sponsored products. And I think in these types of economies, we have fared pretty well in part because we have a number of owned and operated properties that have very large volumes that advertisers and brands want to get in front of. Even in a harder economy, there's going to be a lot of e-commerce purchasing. So, people want to be in front of our customers in our marketplace. Or take ""Thursday Night Football,"" which is we're in our second season of ""Thursday Night Football,"" and off to a great start, the ratings are 25% higher than they were a year ago through six weeks. But also, we're doing much better on the advertising side than we did in our first year, and that's a property that's really valuable. It's the one game that week, and advertisers want to be in front of customers because there's 13 million customers a week watching. So, I think part of it is because we have owned and operated properties that have a lot of volume. And then I think the other piece is that most of our resource in the advertising side is spent on machine learning expert practitioners who are honing algorithms to make sure that the sponsored results people get when they search on something are relevant. And because of that, those ads perform better for advertisers. So, when they have to think about budget decisions, they're going to choose the ones that have large volume and perform better. I think both of those are real advantages in our advertising area right now. In terms of additional things we're excited about. I think that we have barely scraped the surface with respect to figuring out how to intelligently integrate advertising into video, into audio and into grocery. So, I think we're early days in that. I think that we also started externalizing some of our products like sponsored products to third-party websites. And you see that with what we've done with Pinterest, Hearst Newspapers and BuzzFeed, so I think there's -- again, we're still pretty early in that area, but it's growing well, and we're very focused on continuing to in a great customer experience.

Q3_2023,Mark Mahaney,Evercore ISI -- Analyst,"OK. On those AWS deals, Andy, that you talked about in the September quarter, was there something different about those deals, different industry, different verticals, different geographic markets? Or is it just kind of a resumption of kind of the deal flow that you've had in years past? So, that's the first question. And secondly, Brian, international. Is international finally at a point where it can be sustainably profitable going forwards, maybe except for the seasonally challenged March quarter? Have you wrung out enough efficiencies and gotten enough scales? And the oldest markets there are big enough and scalable enough and profitable enough that it offsets the newer countries? Have you finally reached that point? Thanks.",neutral,0.751090467,Neutral,Neutral,0,0.2,0.6,0.2,0,Neutral
Q3_2023,Brian Olsavsky,Chief Financial Officer,"First, just to give Andy a break. On international, thanks for your question. Yes, the quarter was just short of breakeven. And as you pointed out, that's a departure from kind of prior trends. I would answer that question this way. There's multiple things going on internationally. In our established countries, U.K., Germany, Japan, France, those countries are profitable and have been profitable. And we continue to work on price selection and convenience. And all that retail base is essentially adding sellers, adding vendors and selection, scaling advertising and improving the cost structure of our ops network. So, many of the ops productivity initiatives, probably with the exception of regionalization, is more of a U.S. side right now. But we're working on all those productivity elements and speed concurrently globally. And you're seeing that internationally and customers are responding. On the emerging side, over the last six years, we've launched 10 new countries. History has shown us that those all take time to grow into profitability. The U.S. took 10 years -- excuse me, nine years originally. And they're all on their own journey there with growth and scale and profitability and selection and a number of other variables. So, that's -- those are all going well as well. We continue -- we're going to continue to invest internationally in things like Prime and expanding Prime benefits, and we're going to continue to build out the fulfillment and transportation networks to better serve customers. So, I can't say it's permanently we've reached a breakeven threshold for profitability. I think the trend lines are clear, though, and we'll continue to work on accelerating that journey in all countries, especially the emerging ones.",neutral,0.807934701,Neutral,Slightly Positive,0.1,0.4,0.4,0.1,0,Neutral
Q3_2023,Andy Jassy,Chief Executive Officer,"On the AWS deals, it's a really broad mix of industries and geographies. So, it's not comped up in one. Some are kind of first really big deals from customers. Some of them are very large expansions of existing agreements where they've gone from call it, 20% of their workloads to 50% of their workloads moving to AWS in the cloud. It's also -- I'm not even really including in that number, a number of really big public sector deals that we've done over the last chunk of time that won't hit for a period of time. And so, all these deals don't hit in a month. They happen over a period of time as you help those customers safely transition and migrate their workloads to AWS. But it hasn't been any one piece. And I wish I could tell you we knew exactly why they're starting to happen in faster numbers. I do think, in general, historically, deal volume tends to be lumpy, and it doesn't perfectly distribute over a calendar year. I do think though that we've seen this in '23, for sure, that the time to close deals lengthened. And I think it's all reflective of what most companies in the world have been thinking about the last year, which is just in the face of uncertain economy, you're going to be more conservative. There are going to be more people involved. You're going to spend more time on how you can save on your existing cost instead of migrating new workloads or thinking about signing new deals. And so, I think what you're just starting to see along with some of the optimization attenuation is that companies are starting to look forward again. And so, we've just seen a collection of those the last couple of months that had been -- being discussed for several months where I think, frankly, both sides thought they would close faster, but just went slower than they did. So, I just think you're starting to see companies look forward more.",neutral,0.84862113,Neutral,Slightly Positive,0.1,0.4,0.4,0.1,0,Neutral

Q4_2023,Andy Jassy,Chief Executive Officer,"Thanks, Dave. Today, we're reporting $170 billion in revenue, up 13% year over year, excluding the impact from foreign exchange rates, $13.2 billion in operating income, up 383% year over year or $10.5 billion, and $35.5 billion in trailing 12-month free cash flow adjusted for equipment finance leases, up $48.3 billion year over year. While we've made meaningful progress in our financial measures, what we're most pleased about is the continued customer experience improvements across our businesses. These results represent a lot of invention, collaboration, discipline, execution, adjusting, and reimagining from teams across Amazon. Looking back at Q4, I'll start with our stores business, where customers responded to our continued focus on selection, price, and convenience. We continue to have the broadest retail selection with hundreds of millions of products available and added tens of millions of new items last year alone, including fashion selection from Coach, Victoria's Secrets Fashion, Pit Viper and Beyonce's Renaissance tour merch to cosmetics from Lancome, Urban Decay Cosmetics, and KNOW Beauty by Vanessa Hudgens, to consumer technology and services from Boost, Infinite, and Woop, to homewares for Martha Stewart. Being sharp on price is always important but particularly in an uncertain economy, where customers are careful about how much they're spending. We kicked off the holiday season with Prime Big Deal Days, an exclusive event for Prime members to provide an early start on holiday shopping. This was followed by our extended Black Friday and Cyber Monday holiday shopping event, which was open to all customers and ended up being our largest event ever. These events also helped attract new customers and Prime members. Throughout the quarter, customers saved nearly $10 billion across millions of deals and coupons, almost 70% more than last year. In addition to offering great deals, we continue to improve delivery speeds. In 2023, Amazon delivered to Prime members at the fastest speeds ever with more than 7 billion items arriving same or next day, including more than 4 billion in the U.S. and more than 2 billion in Europe. In the U.S., this result is the combination of two things. One is the benefit of regionalization, where we rearchitected the network to store items closer to customers. The other is the expansion of same-day facilities where in the U.S. in the fourth quarter, we increased the number of items delivered the same day overnight by more than 65% year over year. As we're able to get customers items this fast, it increases the number of occasions that customers choose Amazon to fulfill their shopping needs. And we can see that in all sorts of areas, including how fast our everyday essentials business is growing. Our regionalization efforts have also brought transportation distances down, which has helped lower our cost to serve. In 2023, for the first time since 2018, we reduced our cost to serve on a per-unit basis globally. In the U.S. alone cost to serve was down by more than $0.45 per unit compared to the prior year. Lowering cost to serve allows us not only to invest in speed improvements but also afford adding more selection at lower average selling prices or ASPs and profitably. We have a saying that it's not hard to lower prices, it's hard to be able to afford lowering prices. The same is true with adding selection. It's not hard to add lower ASP selection, it's hard to be able to afford offering lower ASP selection and still like the economics. Like improving speed, adding selection puts us in the consideration set for more purchases. As we look toward 2024 and beyond, we're not done lowering our cost to serve. We've challenged every closely held belief in our fulfillment network and reevaluated every part of it and found several areas where we believe we can lower costs while also delivering faster for customers. Our inbound fulfillment architecture and resulting inventory placement are areas of focus in 2024, and we have optimism there's more upside for us. Alongside our stores business, our advertising growth remained strong, up 26% year over year, which is primarily driven by our sponsored ads. We've recently added sponsored TV to this offering in the U.S., a self-service solution for brands to create streaming TV campaigns with no minimum spend, putting this advertising within reach of any business. While still early days, streaming TV advertising continues to grow quickly. Brands are using our capabilities to reach engaged viewers on Twitch, Free V, Fire TV, and Prime Video shows and movies, which just launched in the U.S. as well as Thursday Night Football. Shifting to AWS, revenue in the quarter grew 13% year over year in Q4 versus 12% year over year in Q3, and we're now approaching an annualized revenue run rate of $100 billion. We watched the incremental revenue added each quarter. And in Q4, AWS added more than $1.1 billion of incremental quarter-over-quarter revenue, which on an FX-neutral basis is more than any other cloud provider as far as we can tell. While cost optimization continued to attenuate, larger new deals also accelerated, evidenced by recently inked agreements with Salesforce, BMW, NVIDIA, LG, Hyundai, Merck, MUFG, Axiata, Cathay, BYD, Accor, Amgen, and SAIC. Our customer pipeline remains strong as existing customers are renewing at larger commitments over longer periods and migrations are growing. 2023 also was a very significant year of delivery and customer trial for generative AI or Gen AI in AWS. You may remember that we've explained our vision of three distinct layers in the Gen AI stack, each of which is gigantic and each of which we're deeply investing. At the bottom layer, where customers who are building their own models run training and inference on compute where the chip is the key component in that compute, we offer the most expansive collection of compute instances with NVIDIA chips. We also have customers who like us to push the price performance envelope on AI chips, just as we have with Graviton for generalized CPU chips, which are 40% more price performance than other X86 alternatives. And as a result, we've built custom AI training chips named Trainium and inference chips named Inferentia. At Reinvent, we announced Trainium 2, which offers four times faster training performance and three times memory capacity versus the first generation of Trainium, enabling advantageous price performance versus alternatives. We already have several customers using our AI chips, including Anthropic, Airbnb, Hugging Face, Qualtrics, Rico, and Snap. In the middle layer, where companies seek to leverage an existing large language model, customize it with their own data, and leverage AWS' security and other features, all as a managed service, we've launched Bedrock, which is off to a very strong start with many thousands of customers using the service after just a few months. The team continues to rapidly iterate on Bedrock, recently delivering capabilities, including guardrails to safeguard what questions applications will answer, knowledge basis to expand model's knowledge base with retrieval augmented generation of RAG and real-time queries, agents to complete multistep tasks, and fine-tuning to keep teaching and refining models, all of which will help customers' applications be higher-quality and have better customer experiences. We also added new models from Anthropic, Cohere, Meta with Llama 2, Stability AI, and our own Amazon Titan family of LLMs. What customers have learned at this early stage of Gen AI is that there's meaningful iteration required in building a production Gen AI application with the requisite enterprise quality at the cost and latency needed. Customers don't want only one model. They want different models for different types of applications and different-sized models for different applications. Customers want a service that makes this experimenting and iterating simple. And this is what Bedrock does, which is why so many customers are excited about it. At the top layer of the stack is the application layer, one of the very best early Gen AI applications is a coded companion. At Reinvent, we launched Amazon Q, which is an expert on AWS, writes code, debugs code, tests code, does translations like moving from an old version of Java to a new one, and can also query customers various data repositories like Internet, Wickes or from over 40 different popular connectors to data in Salesforce, Amazon S3, ServiceNow, Slack, Elastin, or Zendesk, among others. And answer questions, summarize this data, carry on a coherent conversation, and take action. It was designed with security and privacy in mind from the start, making it easier for organizations to use generative AI safely. Q is the most capable work assistant and another service that customers are very excited about. By the way, don't underestimate the point about Bedrock and Q inheriting the same security and access control as customers get with AWS. Security is a big deal, an important differentiator between cloud providers. The data in these models is some of the company's most sensitive and critical assets. With AWS' advantaged security capabilities and track record relative to other providers, we continue to see momentum around customers wanting to do their long-term Gen AI work with AWS. We're building dozens of Gen AI apps across Amazon's businesses, several of which have launched, and others of which are in development. This morning, we launched Rufus, an expert shopping assistant trained on our product and customer data that represents a significant customer experience improvement for Discovery. Rufus lets customers ask shopping journey questions like what is the best golf ball to use for better spin control or which are the best cold weather rain jackets and get thoughtful explanations for what matters and recommendations on products. You can carry on a conversation with Rufus on other related or unrelated questions and retains context coherently. You can sift through our rich product pages by asking Rufus questions on any product features and will return answers quickly. We're at the start of what Rufus will do with further personalization and expansion coming, but we're excited about how it will make discovery even easier on Amazon. Gen AI is and will continue to be an area of pervasive focus and investment across Amazon, primarily because there are a few initiatives, if any, that give us the chance to reinvent so many of our customer experiences and processes, and we believe it will ultimately drive tens of billions of dollars of revenue for Amazon over the next several years. In addition to our stores and AWS businesses, we continue to make progress on newer business investments that have the potential to be important to customers and Amazon long term. Touching on two of them, in October, we had a major milestone in our journey to commercialize Project HyPer, which is our low earth orbit satellite initiative that aims to provide broadband connectivity to the 400 million to 500 million households who don't have it today. We launched two end-to-end prototype satellites into space and successfully validated all key systems and subsystems, made a two-way video call, streamed a Prime Video movie in Ultra HD 4K, and made an Amazon purchase over our end-to-end communication network. It's rare to be able to exercise all these elements in an initial launch like this. We're on track to launch our first production satellite in the first half of 2024 and started beta testing in the second half of the year. We've still got a long way to go but are encouraged by our progress. During the quarter, we also completed our second season of Thursday Night Football, which was a rousing success by all accounts. The customer experience continued to improve as our talent, production, streaming quality, analytics, unique AI features like Prime Vision, and defensive alerts, all took big leaps forward on top of the very good start last year. We launched a new NFL tradition with the inaugural Black Friday football game and our continuous innovation resonated with viewers as the number of people watching increased 24% year over year and with advertisers as we made dramatic year-over-year gains in ad sales. We have increasing conviction that Prime Video can be a large and profitable business on its own, and we'll continue to invest in compelling exclusive content for Prime members like Thursday Night Football, Lord of the Rings, Reacher, Mr. & Mr. Smith, Citadel, and more. And with the ads in Prime Video, we'll be able to continue investing meaningfully in content over time. I'll close by reiterating that 2023 was a really good year. I'm grateful to all of our teams who delivered on behalf of customers. Yet I think every one of us at Amazon believes this is just the start of what's possible. We have a long way to go in every one of our businesses before we exhaust how we can make customers' lives better and easier, and there is considerable upside in each of the businesses in which we're investing. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian.",positive,0.915814817,Strong Positive,Slightly Positive,0.1,0.4,0.4,0.1,0,Strong Positive
Q4_2023,Brian Olsavsky,Chief Financial Officer,"Thanks, Andy. Overall, we saw strong performance in the fourth quarter. Worldwide revenue was $170 billion, representing an increase of 13% year over year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, and approximately $3 billion above the top end of our guidance range. Saw our highest quarterly worldwide operating income ever, which was $13.2 billion for the quarter, an increase of $10.5 billion year over year and $2.2 billion above the high end of our guidance range. For the full year 2023, we had a meaningful improvement across our financial results. Revenue was $574.8 billion, an increase of 12% year over year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Operating income tripled year over year to $36.9 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow adjusted for equipment finance leases was $35.5 billion, up $48.3 billion versus last year. These financial outputs are a result of a lot of improvements in our key input metrics such as stores' cost to serve, which decreased year over year for the first time since 2018, and our ability to deliver to customers at our fastest speeds ever. I want to thank our customers, our partners, and our teammates around the world for a very strong 2023 performance. Focusing on the fourth quarter, North America revenue was $105.5 billion, an increase of 13% year over year and an acceleration of 200 basis points compared to Q3. International revenue was $40.2 billion, an increase of 13% year over year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, also an acceleration of 200 basis points compared to Q3. During the quarter, we remained focused on the inputs that matter most to our customers, price, selection, and convenience. Our shopping events throughout the quarter included Prime Big Deal Days in October and our extended Black Friday and Cyber Monday shopping event helped to attract new Prime members and deliver billions in savings for customers. We made meaningful progress on delivery speeds in the United States and globally, which helped strong sales throughout the quarter, including notable strength in the last-minute gifting where our ability to provide fast shipping helped our Prime members ensure that they got their gifts before the holidays. These improvements in delivery speed have led to increased purchase frequency by our Prime members across all of our major geographies. It also strengthened demand for our everyday essentials. Categories like beauty and health and personal care, where speed is even more important to customers. Third-party sellers were a big part of our success over the holidays with worldwide third-party seller services revenue growing at 19% year over year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. And worldwide third-party seller unit mix was 61%, its highest level ever. We also saw strong performance in worldwide advertising, which grew 26% year over year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. The strength in advertising was primarily driven by sponsored products as our teams worked hard to increase the relevancy of the ads we show customers by leveraging machine learning. Advertising only works if the ads are helpful to customers and there's a lot of value in tailoring sponsored products, so they are relevant to what a customer is actually searching for. We're also continually focused on improving our measurement capabilities, which allow brands to see the payback of their advertising spend. Shifting to profitability. North America segment operating income was $6.5 billion, an increase of $6.7 billion year over year, resulting in an operating margin of 6.1%, up 120 basis points quarter over quarter. Since North America operating margins were at their recent low levels in Q1 of 2022, we have now seen seven consecutive quarters of improvement resulting in a cumulative improvement of 800 basis points over these past seven quarters. In addition to the strong top-line growth, which helped to drive improved leverage throughout our businesses, we continue to make progress on reducing our cost to serve. The fourth quarter is our busiest time of year, supported by an increasingly large and integrated operations network. Overall, our teams executed extremely well, yielding strong efficiency gains with minimal disruptions. We were pleased with the performance of our regionalized network during the holiday period, where we saw benefits from improved inventory placement helping drive faster speeds and also lowering costs. We also continue to see benefits from lower transportation rates, which include linehaul, ocean, and rail, and from a more stable labor market, resulting in improved staffing levels. In our International segment, we had an operating loss of $419 million, an improvement of $1.8 billion year over year. This improvement was primarily driven by lowering our cost to serve through increased units per box, lower transportation rates, and leverage across our fixed costs as we continue to focus on customer inputs and improve efficiencies within our operations. The International segment represents more than 20 countries of varying degrees of growth and our largest established countries like the U.K., Germany, and Japan, relatively strong revenue growth contributed to the year-over-year improvement in profitability. Additionally, we saw good progress in our emerging countries as they continued to expand their customer offerings while seeking to invest wisely. Moving to AWS. Revenues were $24.2 billion, an increase of 13% year over year. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, we added more than $1.1 billion of revenue in AWS as customers are continuing to shift their focus toward driving innovation and bringing new workloads to the cloud. Similar to what we shared last quarter, we continue to see the diminishing impact of cost optimizations. And as these optimizations slow down, we're seeing more companies turning their attention to newer initiatives and reaccelerating existing migrations. Customers are also excited about our approach to generative AI. Still relatively early days, but the revenues are accelerating rapidly across all three layers and our approach to democratizing AI is resonating well with our customers. We have seen significant interest from our customers wanting to run generative AI applications and build large language models and foundation models, all with the privacy, reliability, and security they have grown accustomed to with AWS. AWS' operating income was $7.2 billion, an increase of $2 billion year over year. Our operating margin for the quarter was 29.6%, up more than 500 basis points year over year and effectively flat on a quarter-over-quarter basis. This margin improvement reflects our headcount reductions from earlier in the year and a slowdown in the pace of hiring. Shifting to free cash flow. On a trailing 12-month basis, free cash flow adjusted for finance leases was $35.5 billion, an improvement of $48.3 billion year over year. The largest driver of the improvement in free cash flow is our increased operating income, which we are seeing across all three of our segments. We're also seeing improvements in working capital, notably in inventory efficiency driven by our regionalization efforts. Next, let's turn to capital investments. We define our capital investments as a combination of capex plus equipment finance leases. In 2023, full-year capex was $48.4 billion, which was down $10.2 billion year over year, primarily driven by lower spend on fulfillment and transportation. As we look forward to 2024, we anticipate capex to increase year over year, primarily driven by increased infrastructure capex, support growth of our AWS business, including additional investments in generative AI and large language models. One thing I'd like to highlight in our first-quarter guidance is that we recently completed a useful life study for our servers, and we are increasing the useful life from five years to six years beginning in January 2024. We will have this anticipated benefit to our operating income of approximately $900 million in Q1, which is included in our operating income guidance. As we turn the calendar to 2024, we are excited to continue upon the great work the teams have been able to deliver in 2023. We remain focused on streamlining and prioritizing projects in an effective way that reduces costs and also allows us to continue innovating and inventing for customers. With that, let's move on to questions. Operator At this time, we will now open the call up for questions. We ask each caller to please limit yourself to one question.  At this time, please hold while we poll for questions. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.",positive,0.958784938,Strong Positive,Slightly Positive,0.1,0.4,0.4,0.1,0,Strong Positive
Q4_2023,Eric Sheridan,Goldman Sachs -- Analyst,"Thank you so much for taking the questions. I'm just going to do a two-parter on AWS. If we take a step back, can you talk a little bit about the contribution from backlog conversion, AI workloads, and some elements that allowed you to reaccelerate revenue at AWS in Q4 and how we should think about those components from an exit velocity point into 2024? And then against your broader comments on capex, any color on how we should be thinking about AI-driven capex within the AWS initiatives against the broader capex commentary? Thank you.",neutral,0.914344132,Neutral,Neutral,0,0.2,0.6,0.2,0,Neutral
Q4_2023,Dave Fildes,"Director, Investor Relations","Yeah, that's right. This is Dave. Just to give you that -- the balance was $155.7 billion as of 12/31. So, that's up more than $45 billion year over year and $20 billion quarter over quarter.",neutral,0.646016717,Neutral,Neutral,0,0.2,0.6,0.2,0,Neutral
Q4_2023,Brian Olsavsky,Chief Financial Officer,"And then, you know, if you look back at the revenue growth, it accelerated to 13.2% in Q4 as we just mentioned. That was an acceleration. We expect accelerating trends to continue into 2024. We're excited about the migrate -- continuous resumption, I guess, of migrations that companies may have put on hold during 2023 in some cases and interest in our generative AI and products, like Bedrock and as Andy was describing that. On the capex side, let me talk in total for the company. We had $48 billion in 2023 was down $10 billion year over year. We talked about during the year quite a bit, a lot of the mix of investment in 2023 was tied to infrastructure, mostly supporting AWS but also supporting our core Amazon businesses was about 60% of our spend. So, it reached a very high percentage. We anticipate those trends continuing into 2024. capex will go up in 2024. I'm not giving a number today, but we do -- we're still working through plans for the year, but we do expect capex to rise as we add capacity in AWS for region expansions, but primarily the work we're doing with generative AI projects. In the fulfillment center and logistics area, I would say it's more incremental capacity at this point based on additional demand, although we are seeing some additional investments for same-day delivery sites and automation, robotics. But the trend for most of the large percentage of the spend will be in infrastructure is going to continue into 2024.",negative,0.385361761,Slightly Negative,Slightly Positive,0.1,0.4,0.4,0.1,0,Slightly Positive
Q4_2023,Andy Jassy,Chief Executive Officer,"To add a few things to what Brian said, I think just as it relates to the first part of the question, just the way to think about backlog conversion is just these are deals that we've signed that are long-term deals typically with customers. And then there's some amount of time it takes where we work with those customers to migrate those workloads. And so, some of the trends that we have seen over the last quarter. First of all, I think that the lion's share of cost optimization has happened. It's not that there won't be any more or that we don't see anymore, but it's just attenuated very significantly. And at the same time, what we've seen is that migrations and this speaks to some of the backlog, migrations that were proceeding, but maybe not at the pace that we saw before, have started to pick up again. We've also seen that a number of the deals that typically signed more quickly, but were signing more slowly in more uncertain environments. A lot of those got done in the last quarter, and you heard in my opening remarks some of the examples, but that was some of several, and we're continuing to see that trend. And then on the Gen AI side, it's -- if you look at the Gen AI revenue we have, in absolute numbers, it's a pretty big number, but in the scheme of a $100 billion annual revenue run rate business, it's still relatively small, much smaller than what it will be in the future, where we really believe we're going to drive tens of billions of dollars of revenue over the next several years. But it's encouraging, how fast it's growing, and our offering is really resonating with customers. Operator And the next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.",neutral,0.849015176,Neutral,Slightly Positive,0.1,0.4,0.4,0.1,0,Slightly Positive
Q4_2023,Brian Nowak,Morgan Stanley -- Analyst,"Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. Andy, the first one is sort of on the cost-to-serve comments coming down for the first time since 2018. As you sort of look into '24 and '25, can you just sort of walk us through some of the key operational blocking and tackling this to happen to continue to drive down that cost of serve back to 2018 levels or however you're thinking about your North Star from that perspective? And then the second one is on sort of philosophical about capital returns. It looks like the cash balance could start building pretty nicely here. How do you think about the idea of buybacks, share repurchases, or some type of capital return programs to sort of help shareholders out?",neutral,0.868507743,Neutral,Slightly Positive,0.1,0.4,0.4,0.1,0,Neutral
Q4_2023,Andy Jassy,Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah. Thank you, Brian. I appreciate it. I'll take the first, and I'll let Brian take the second. On the cost to serve coming down, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, I don't think that we feel like where we're going to ultimately be. I think we feel like we have meaningful upside there. And I think one thing that it's easy to make as large a change as we made in regionalization in the U.S. and saying, check, we got that done. But the reality is, we still have several improvements and a bunch of ways that we can hone the regionalization improvements that we made in 2023 and in 2024. And so, when the team speaks about the areas where they believe they have opportunities, there's still opportunities just in regionalization as we continue to hone that, but I also think, in many ways, it was very useful for us to go through what was a pretty significant change we went through during the pandemic, where we doubled the size of our fulfillment center network in 18 months and built out a last mile transportation network, the size of UPS in 18 months. It was disruptive to get that optimized. But one of the things that was very useful was, it really caused us to relook at everything we were doing with fulfillment network. And we looked at it really a beginner's eye and we have found so many areas that we believe that we can evolve that I think will both help our cost to serve and even more importantly, deliver faster delivery speeds for customers. And I mentioned one area which, in particular, which you'll see us focus on over the next year or two is just, we think there are real opportunities in our inbound network and our inbound processes. And then where we locate inventory in association with that, which will accomplish both of those tasks. But for us, I don't believe that we believe that 2018 is the North Star in cost to serve. I think we believe we can keep evolving it and being better than that.",neutral,0.582100451,Neutral,Slightly Positive,0.1,0.4,0.4,0.1,0,Slightly Positive
Q4_2023,Brian Olsavsky,Chief Financial Officer,"Yeah, I'd just add a couple of other items there. We've gotten a lot better at fixed cost controls, as we scale. And I think you're seeing that as part of our ability to lower cost per serve not only in operations, it's actually throughout the company. And we're seeing a reduction in some of the inflationary factors that hit us in -- especially hard in 2021 and 2022, things like transportation services, fuel, and others. So, not totally out of the woods there, but coming down, and we still see some more upside. On your share repurchase question, first of all, just really excited to actually have that question. No one's asked me that in three years and appreciate it. But we have come through a tumultuous period where, as Andy just said, we doubled the size of our logistics footprint and invested heavily in -- we saw that negative free cash flow, at least on all two calculation for the period 2021 to 2022. So, we're glad to see the improvement in the bounce back in free cash flow. A lot of -- and we do debate and discuss capital structure policies annually or more often. And I have nothing to announce today, but again, we primarily think we have a lot of strong investments in front of us. We're good -- we're glad to have the liquidity -- better liquidity at the end of 2023, and we're going to try to continue to build that. Operator And our next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.",positive,0.759512067,Slightly Positive,Slightly Positive,0.1,0.4,0.4,0.1,0,Slightly Positive
Q4_2023,Doug Anmuth,JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst,"Thanks for taking the questions. Brian, you've seen very good improvement in International profitability over the last several quarters. Can you just talk about some of the levers here that you're thinking about just as you look to move into positive operating income and then how International could potentially approach North America levels over time? And then just a follow-up there. Are you seeing any shipping disruptions currently related to the Red Sea and does that factor into your outlook at all for 1Q? Thanks.",positive,0.679693758,Slightly Positive,Neutral,0,0.2,0.6,0.2,0,Neutral
Q4_2023,Brian Olsavsky,Chief Financial Officer,"Yeah. Let me start with the second one first. So, we're mindful of the geopolitical issues around the world, especially as you say in the supply chain and how that might impact shipments both to the U.S. and to Europe. We're just working very hard to make that not back up on customers, and we'll continue to work that. It's not a material impact into the -- estimated in our guidance in Q1. But again, as I said, we're vigilant on that, and we'll work to take steps where we need to, to make sure that customer experience is not impacted. On the International segment, operating income, yes, we're very pleased with the results, especially over the last few quarters. We improved operating income by $1.8 billion year over year. And I would attribute it to the steady progress that Andy was saying about the U.S. is, again, cost of serve down, advertising is stronger, a lot of attention to cost, a lot of attention to investments, and we are going to invest and other fixed cost control. So, a lot of that is what we're seeing in the established countries of Europe and Japan. I would divide the segment a bit into a couple of buckets. First, there's that International segment, excuse me, European established country segment. And that's -- it behaves a lot like you would see in North America. If you look at the emerging countries -- and again, we've launched 10 countries in the last seven years. They're all on their own trajectory of journey to profitability and significance with customers, and we're pleased with that. I think they're all growing nicely and, again, leveraging their cost structure, investing wisely in Prime benefits but all on a curve to breakeven and then be a contributor to income and free cash flow. The other thing I'd point out is that we have advanced loaded, I would say, price benefits in our International markets. We think it's a very good source of customer acquisition and customer retention. The investment in those areas can fluctuate quarter to quarter. We had a bit of a higher spend in -- excuse me, in digital content in Q4 as we had a number of marketing and content, especially around live sports, English Premier League, and Champions League in Germany and Italy, for example. But we like those benefits in those investments, different proven vehicle for customer acquisition, as I said, and it gets people shopping at our sites, and engaging with benefits is always positive for the relationship with Amazon. Operator And the next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.",positive,0.796607912,Slightly Positive,Slightly Positive,0.1,0.4,0.4,0.1,0,Slightly Positive
Q4_2023,Mark Mahaney,Evercore ISI -- Analyst,"OK. Thanks. Two questions, please. I think you mentioned, Brian, that the North American margins have improved for seven quarters in a row or something like that, a significant number. I would assume that most of the factors like rising capacity utilization given your capex commentary about retail, the regional center efficiencies, and then overall, moderation in shipping and logistics costs, labor costs, I mean, all these factors probably mean that we'll continue to get an improvement in North American margins, but if you would comment on that. And then secondly, on the Primetime Video -- Amazon Prime video, I know we just launched. But could you provide any color or context on expectations around that? You've got a massive number of Prime users who are coming in with a reasonable CPM with low ad load, but it seems like there should be a substantial opportunity for you. So, if you want to try to size that for us or how you think about the upside, that would be really appreciated. Thank you.",positive,0.803799093,Slightly Positive,Slightly Positive,0.1,0.4,0.4,0.1,0,Neutral
Q4_2023,Brian Olsavsky,Chief Financial Officer,"Sure, Mark. Thank you. I think Andy laid it out pretty well a few minutes ago on the cost structure, the regionalization, the -- growing into the assets that we added during the pandemic, great efficiency, and work with productivity across really all of our operations network fixed -- attention to fixed cost and lowering costs where we can, maintaining costs where we can, the increase in advertising, success in advertising revenue growth that's outpaced our traffic growth rates. So, all of those trends we expect to continue, and we're going to work hard to make sure they continue. And as we said, we have one guidepost is maybe pre-pandemic profitability, but we are working to -- we're not putting a limit on our improvement. We're going to continue to look for ways to lower the cost to serve. And I might add, at the same time, increase the customer experience because we did that -- we had that cost improvement at the same time when we at first got back to our shipping speeds from pre-pandemic and then exceeded them. So, we're happy with that, and we'll continue to do both to improve the customer experience and also to lower our costs and leverage our cost structure. Yes, your second question on ads, I can't scale it right now. I mean, what I would say for ads in videos is that advertisers are excited to access our Prime customer base. We are looking for ways to increase our advertising in our streaming properties, including Fire TV, but also -- and Prime Video, but also things like Free V and Twitch. And it's an important part of the total business model, and we expect it will allow us to have a healthy business to continue to invest in content and to continue to grow that. And we feel good about it, and we -- the way we anticipate the ads progressing, we will not have heavy ad loads relative to see other network TV and other things. And like all of our advertising, we're trying to be useful for customers. Operator And our next question comes from the line of Scott Devitt with Wedbush Securities. Please proceed with your question.",positive,0.849146962,Slightly Positive,Slightly Positive,0.1,0.4,0.4,0.1,0,Slightly Positive
Q4_2023,Scott Devitt,Wedbush Securities -- Analyst,"Thanks, everyone. I have one on grocery and one on healthcare. First, on grocery, I was wondering if you could talk a bit about the progress that you're making in unifying the offering between Dotcom, Fresh, and Whole Foods. And as it relates to reverse logistics and using the grocery facilities, how that's lowering the cost of logistics, and whether there is a significant opportunity there in terms of driving traffic and revenue in the grocery business? Then secondly, on healthcare, in such a poor -- notoriously poor customer experience industry, you've made significant efforts now within acquisition and offering primary care. Just be curious if you could talk a little bit more about the longer-term vision in healthcare. Thank you.",neutral,0.817006707,Neutral,Slightly Positive,0.1,0.4,0.4,0.1,0,Neutral
Q4_2023,Andy Jassy,Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah. On grocery, we're pleased with the progress we're making there. When we think about our grocery business right now and kind of, I'll call it, three big macro segments. The first is nonperishables where these are things like consumables and canned goods and pet food and health and beauty products and pharmaceutical. And we -- it's a big business and it's continuing to grow at a very healthy clip, and we're really pleased with that business. And it's really the way the most mass merchandise -- mass merchandisers got into the grocery business a few decades ago. So, that continues to grow at a very healthy clip. We have a physical presence along with online, but Whole Foods market, which is really the pioneer and the leader in organic grocery and that's continuing to grow at a very good clip. We also made a number of changes in the business last year on the profitability side, where we really like the profitability trajectory we see there. And so, again, you'll see that keep growing and expanding and feel very good about that as well. If you want to serve as many grocery needs as we do, you have to have a mass physical presence. And that's what we've been trying to do with Fresh over several years. We have tested -- we've been testing a V2 of our Fresh format in a few locations near Chicago, in a few locations in Southern California. It's very early. It's just a few months in, but the results thus far are very promising and on almost every dimension. And so, we need to see it for a little bit longer time, but the results appear like we have something that's resonating. And if we continue to see that then the issue becomes how fast and what's the best way to expand. We have also been spending increasing amounts of time and efforts here trying to make it easier for customers to be able to shop between the nonperishables and then our selection of Whole Foods as well as Fresh, I think you can expect to see that over time, both in the user experience on the app and on the website as well as how we're able to better leverage between the different business segments and their logistics capabilities, being able to get better leverage there, better economics and then allowing people to order in one conservative place to be able to pick up in multiple -- pick up for multiple types of grocery products in one place. You're seeing us already do more of that, and I think you can expect that in the future. In the healthcare space, I -- if you think about what we do on the retail side, adding a pharmacy capability is a pretty natural extension. It's something that customers had asked us for, for many years, and it's got more complexity to it than the rest of our retail business. So, we have to think carefully about whether we wanted to pursue it, but customers so badly wanted it, and the experience we thought could be better and we could be a meaningful part of changing that that we pursued it. And I really like the momentum that we're seeing in our Amazon Pharmacy business. It's growing really quickly. But even more important with how fast it's growing, if you've used it and you've paid attention to the customer experience over the last 12 to 15 months, it's just substantially improved from where it already was pretty good. People really love the experience. And I think that when -- the healthcare experience, particularly in the U.S. is a pretty frustrating one and not a very good one. And I think that when we tell our grandkids that the way we used to have to go get primary care was to make an appointment three weeks in advance and then drive 20 minutes to the doctor, park, wait in the reception for 15 minutes, get put into an exam room for 15 minutes. Doctor comes in, talks to you for five to 10 minutes, and then you got to drive 20 minutes to the pharmacy. People are just not -- our grandkids will not believe that was the experience and it's not going to be, and you already see that changing. And it's part of what attracted us in such a significant way to a medical. It's just their application, their app is so easy to use. You have all your healthcare data in one spot. You can do chats with medical practitioners. You can do video calls. If you need to see someone, there's physical locations and lots of metropolis cities where you can get in the same day. If you need to see a specialist, they're plugged into specialists in all the cities in which we operate, where you can get in a day or two later. It's a very different experience. Now, if you actually need medication, you can get that sent to you in a day or two, either through Amazon pharmacy or other pharmacies that we work with. And that experience is so much better than what we've been accustomed to seeing. And so, I think it's -- again, it's still early days. We're excited. We launched for Prime members the ability to get one medical subscription for $9 a month or $99 a year, which is 50% off the typical price and that saw a very good take-up. So, it's still early days, but we think we have an opportunity to be a meaningful part of changing that experience. And if we are helpful in changing what that primary care experience is and what it looks like to get pharmaceutical items, there's a lot of other things that we might be able to help customers with over time, whether it's wellness or whether it's diet. There's a bunch of areas that I think we can help over time. Operator And our final question will come from the line of Colin Sebastian with Baird. Please proceed with your question.",neutral,0.946689725,Neutral,Slightly Positive,0.1,0.4,0.4,0.1,0,Slightly Positive
Q4_2023,Colin Sebastian,Robert W. Baird and Company -- Analyst,"Thanks very much. I just wanted to follow up on AWS for a moment. You outlined the generative AI stack, which I think is -- which is very clear. So, I'm just curious maybe how you're going to market within the application layer given sort of the competitive dynamics of that. And then maybe expand, if you could, Andy, a little bit on the strategy for Gene AI on the consumer-facing side of the business. I know you launched Rufus today. Is that an area that you think could materially improve conversion rates and the overall consumer engagement on retail apps or what's your vision there? Thank you.",neutral,0.779640853,Neutral,Slightly Positive,0.1,0.4,0.4,0.1,0,Neutral
Q4_2023,Andy Jassy,Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah. So, Colin, I would say a few things on -- first on generative AI. It's -- when we talk to customers, particularly at enterprises as they're thinking about generative AI, many are still thinking through at which layers of those three layers of the stack, I laid out that they want to operate in. And we predict that most companies will operate in at least two of them. But I also think even though it may not be the case early on, I think many of the technically capable companies will operate at all three. They will build their own models. They will leverage existing models from us, and then they're going to build the apps. And I know one of the other interesting things that we see early on right now in generative AI is that -- it's a very iterative process and real work to go from posing a question into a chatbot and getting an answer to turning that into a production quality application at the quality you need for your customer experience and your reputation and then also getting that application to work at the latency and cost characteristics that you need. And so, what we see is that customers want choice. They don't want just one model to rule the world. They want different models for different applications. And they want to experiment with all different-sized models because they yield different cost structures and different latency characteristics. And so, Bedrock is really resonating with customers. They just -- they know they want to change all these variables and try and experiment and they have something that manages all those different transitions and changes, so they can figure out what works best for them, especially in the first couple of years where they're learning how to build successful generative applications is incredibly important for them. So, it's part of why we see Bedrock resonating so much. In the same way, what's attractive to enterprises when they think about coding companions like Q, is just if you can get 30%, 40% better productivity for your developers, which in many cases, for companies is their most scarce resource, it's a game changer. And they won't roll out every bit of code that comes from a coding companion. But if it can assist them to get 80% plus the way there quickly, that's a big deal. And one of the things that's unique about Q is it's not just a coding companion, yes, it's an expert on AWS. It will help you -- it helps you write the code, but it also helps you debug the code, and it helps you test the code, helps you do transformations, and it helps you figure out how a multistep implement features. There's a lot of -- helps you troubleshoot. If there's something in your application that's you write, you can find it and help you fix it. And so -- and then it also lets you look at all your data repositories, whether it's Internet or Wickes or the 40-plus data connectors like Salesforce, Atlassian, and Zendesk and Slack. And let you have an intelligent conversation to get answers and take action. So, it's a pretty differentiated capability there. And when enterprises are looking at how they might best make their developers more productive, they're looking at what's the array of capabilities in these different coding companion options they have. And so, we're spending a lot of time -- our enterprises are quite excited about it. It created a meaningful Reinvent. And what you see typically is that these companies experiment with different options they have, and they make decisions for their employee base, and we're seeing very good momentum there. The question about how we're thinking about Gen AI in our consumer businesses. We're building dozens of generative AI applications across the company. It's every business that we have has multiple generative AI applications that we are building. And they're all in different stages, many of which have launched and others of which are in development. So, if you just look at our -- some of our consumer businesses, on the retail side, we built a generative AI application that allowed customers to look at summary of customer reviews so that they didn't have to read hundreds and sometimes thousands of reviews to get a sense for what people like or dislike about a product. We launched a generative AI application that allows customers to quickly be able to predict what kind of fit they'd have for different apparel items. We built a generative AI application in our fulfillment centers that forecasts how much inventory we need in each particular fulfillment center. And so, the start of the rollout of Rufus today is really just another step, but we think one that's pretty meaningful in being a generative AI-powered shopping assistant and it's trained on our very expansive product catalog as well as our community Q&A and customer reviews and the broader web. But it lets customers discover items in a very different way than they have been able to on e-commerce websites. So, if you want buying advice, like what should I look for in a pair of headphones, or if you are doing purpose buying, like what should I buy for cold weather golf or comparisons, what's difference in lip-gloss or lip oil or you want recommendations of the best Valentine's Day gifts or you're on a detailed page with bridge product info, where you don't want to go through the whole page, you want to ask is this pickleball rack that's good for beginners. All those questions you can pull in and get really good answers. And then it's seamlessly integrated in the Amazon experience that customers are used to and love to be able to take action. So, I think that that's just the next iteration. I think it's going to meaningfully change what discovery looks like for our shopping experience and for our customers. And I could kind of step through every one of those consumer businesses. Our advertising business is building capabilities where people can submit a picture and ad copy is written and the other way around. And you kind of think about Alexa, where we're building a very large -- expansive large language model is going to make Alexa even more productive and helpful for customer. Every one of our consumer businesses has a significant number of generative AI applications that they either have built and delivered or they're in the process of building. And I don't see that changing for many years. We have a lot of ideas.",neutral,0.924740434,Neutral,Slightly Positive,0.1,0.4,0.4,0.1,0,Slightly Positive
